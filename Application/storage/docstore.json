Keep it simple  \nThe mistake many small businesses make is that they try to  find a CRM application that \ndoes too much. Take the time to find out what your internal needs really are and who \nwill use the CRM daily. Once you have that, then you are better placed to improve your \nclient relationships and build loyalty.  \n2. Stay in touc h \nMake customer communications timely and relevant.   Don\u2019t spam existing customers, \nbut also be careful not to contact them too infrequently. Targeting tailored messages at \ncustomers according to what they are interested in, via their preferred medium, is the \nbest way to build relationship.  \n3. Build a partnership  \nTake an active interest in your customer\u2019s business and move from doing what\u2019s \nexpected of you, to getting more involved in your customer\u2019s world.   Where you aspire to \nbuilding a long -term relation ship with a specific customer, make efforts to understand \ntheir business objectives and company ethos so you can become more than just a \nsupplier.  \n4.

Be sure to ask your customers what is \nimportant to them and find out why your customers do business with you so you can \nensure you are meeting their needs.  \n6.

When I first started baking whole grain breads over twenty yearsago, baking bread was my hobby.This hobby evolved into an avid inter-est and love for using a wide variety of God\u2019s amazing grains.  Eventuallyit became my entry point into a pursuit of sound nutritional principles,taking responsibility for my family\u2019s health and mastering other home-making skills such as gardening, canning and dehydrating.  Whatever your motives for learning, I believe that baking your ownbread fulfills a deep, natural inborn desire within every man and womanto return to a simpler, slower life where the fundamental act of breakinghomemade bread with family and others is the beginning of fulfillingthese deep longings within, and a natural way to establish relationshipswith mankind from any culture around the world. Those with busy schedules might enjoy baking for the fun of it.  Thiswill give you the opportunity to enjoy blessing your family, and it is alsoa great activity to share with children who love to eat what they make.Sometimes, husbands and children will be a bit, shall I say, resistantto new foods, especially if they are considered healthier!  One lady wroteto me saying: For years my husband thought the idea of buying a flour  millwas \u2018out there\u2019and he didn't okay my purchasing it - I can't tellyou how  gratifying it is that he became a convert so quickly.We have all felt much more energetic since making the switchto home-milled, home-baked bread.Susan Davis, MNBaking bread need not be complicated, either.  My basic whole wheatbread recipe has very few ingredients, and once the recipe is masteredthere are dozens of easy bread variations.  Here is what another clientwrote: I've been reading some other websites and recipes but they allsound difficult and scary.  I'm not much of a baker or cook, soI'm sticking with Marilyn\u2019s Famous Whole Wheat Bread Recipefor good!  I've found it is the easiest and tastiest bread recipe wehave ever tried.  There is no need to look any further.Thanks. This book is my attempt to put together a basic beginner\u2019s bread bak-ing guide.  It includes background information regarding ingredients,supplies and equipment, along with basic and reliable recipes to get youstarted.  Many of you, as I am, are busy people who do not have all dayto nurture their baking efforts.  As such, you will find my instructionsand techniques are designed to fit in with today\u2019s busy lifestyles.  My recipes for yeast breads depend on basic ingredients, freshlymilled flour (if possible), basic skills, and a willingness to learn.  Armedwith modern equipment and a little know-how, you can set aside a week-ly time slot for family baking, and you will learn to incorporate this prac-tice into your routine with minimal disruption. \n89\n", "doc_id": "baa4930e-5a85-4cc5-bc6f-04a029a66113", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "157d5591b7d56ab9de3113cb0bf41dbcd6b1f47da2d906c9c178a7c699b42076", "extra_info": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "12.

Let me introduce youto a few of the benefits of baking with basic ingredients.  The satisfac-tion of making something that is economical, nutritious, and taps into ourcreative side is truly heart warming and encouraging to us as moms.I had been baking our family\u2019s whole grain baked goods for a fewyears when my oldest daughter, at the time about 5 years old, asked myhusband, Duane, who was filling in for a friend\u2019s newspaper route, if shecould help on the route.  He told Laura that he would take her out tobreakfast if she wanted to get up early (4 AM!) and accompany him onthe route.  After the route was completed that morning, Laura orderedpancakes at the restaurant.  After taking a couple bites, she said, \u201cDaddy,this tastes funny.  I can\u2019t eat it.\u201d  White flour pancakes were no longerappetizing to her; she wanted the real thing - mom\u2019s whole grain pan-cakes!There are two ways to react to this restaurant vignette; disappoint-ment at the wasted breakfast, or pleasure, fulfillment and contentmentthat your efforts to provide nourishing foods resulted in a young daugh-ter who naturally preferred the superior whole grain taste.  If you\u2019ve triedto bake your own bread before and met with less than desirable results,or  if you have a family that was not receptive to the new tastes, takeheart!  It can be accomplished gradually with patience and determina-tion.SuperiorNutritionDid you know that whole grain wheat has 26 naturally occurringvitamins and minerals, along with quality fiber, wheat germ, and oil?Unfortunately the refining process removes these powerful nutritionalingredients.  White refined flour has four B-vitamins added back inwhich are not even in the original proportions.  That's it!  Consumingwhite flour products is like being robbed of necessary vitamins and min-erals. Your body needs nutrient dense foods for good health.  The term\u201cnutrient dense\u201d refers to foods that naturally contain a high spectrum of1011", "doc_id": "df8d97b9-8025-4a5a-8def-2697a11fa9a5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "edb92386935e1c84ecc3e6a7781851062495f429c063d508c6ffc0c87d920745", "extra_info": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "12.

Other than calories, refined flour baked goodscontain little nutritional value.  Many of us have grown accustomed tospending our family\u2019s precious grocery dollars on items that do not satis-fy the body nutritionally, or that are largely manufactured and processedfoods made of inferior ingredients at significant costbecause that is the way we were raised..Anumber of common degenerative diseases, such ashemorrhoids, constipation, arthritis, cancer,diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and allergiesare associated with low fiber diets along withthe consumption of refined and processedfoods.  I, too, have been guilty of buying junkfoods as a treat and convenience foods at awhim, or because my children would beg fornutritionally deficient cheesey curls or chips.  My heart\u2019s desire is to spend preciousgrocery dollars on nutritionally superior foods and learn to make them adelicious alternative.  And it\u2019s not that hard.  My husband, who grew uploving white bread with peanut butter and jelly, now thinks it\u2019s disgust-ing.  It\u2019s a matter of what you become accustomed to eating.  Taste budsthat have been accustomed to tasteless foods gradually accommodate thechange to more flavorful whole foods.Taking responsibility for your family\u2019s health by cooking most ofyour meals from basic whole food ingredients seems like a huge under-taking to modern homemakers who have been raised on the convenienceof over-processed commercial breads, cereals, crackers, muffins, rolls,etc.  Our goal is to take this nutritional adventure one step at a timealways remembering that gradual change is permanent change;quick changes generally are neither lasting nor effective.EconomyRecently, I calculated the cost of making Marilyn\u2019s Famous WholeWheat Bread.  My cost came in at under one dollar, at the time of thiswriting, for a 1  1/2 pound loaf of whole grain goodness.  Depending onthe cost of your ingredients you will be able to make superior tastingbread for a similar cost because you will be eliminating the cost of  theplastic disposable packaging, the bakery\u2019s overhead for producing thebread, the transportation costs to ship the bread from the bakery to thestore, the bakery manager's salary, and other costs of purchasing ready-made breads.Depending on the size of your family and how many loaves of breadyours consumes each week, you can calculate the annual savings.   Forexample, in my family, we consume four loaves of sandwich bread aweek.  Commercial equivalent bread costs $4.25 in my area, and beloware the savings you can realize by making your own bread: If I make cinnamon rolls, dinner rolls, homemade pancakes, waffles,biscuits etc., Ican increase the savings.  Several years back, a customer told me that she quit baking herhomemade bread for a while, and that is when her son had an appendici-tis attack.  She believes it was related to returning to a white bread diet.The emergency surgery and hospital bills were covered by insurance, buttheir portion of the bill would have more than paid for a brand new milland mixer.The point I\u2019m making is that when we take responsibility for ourfamily\u2019s health, medical bills can diminish dramatically.Another cus-tomer contacted me recently and reported thatmaking nutritional changes in her family\u2019s dietduring a one year time period had cut theirmedical expenses in half that year compared tothe previous year.This resulted in savings ofover $1,000 for her family in medical andpharmacy bills.  Our family has not needed tosee a doctor for other than emergencies (a bro-ken arm, a bike accident) or sports and campphysicals for many years.SatisfactionAmother who is busy at home cooking and baking from", "doc_id": "d9fe4158-14a2-4aaf-a53c-83b69d9dda75", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "eb909000462a1c0c2f7eb2c5a1b219b0ce8308d39551c64b434ef9f05701be97", "extra_info": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "12.

Wheat is the number one cereal grain produced worldwide andused widely in the United States.  When Cyrus McCormick invented amechanical reaper around 1831, it made a much higher production ofgrain possible than could be accomplished previously with hand scythesor sickles.  As a result, grains, including wheat, became a much moreversatile commodity.Wheat  breads are unique from most other cereal grains used in breadmaking because wheat contains a much higher percentage of a proteincalled gluten.  The benefit of gluten is that it becomes stretchy afterkneading, which enables the bread dough to hold it\u2019s shape during andafter rising.Think of stretchy gluten like a blowing up a balloon.  As the yeastferments or \u201cconsumes\u201d the starch in the flour, carbon dioxide is createdand becomes trapped in the gluten strands or \u201cballoons\u201d of the breaddough.  Gradually, the carbon dioxide raises the bread similar to blowingup a balloon.  Historically, societies have preferred yeast leavened breadswhen they are available.In America today, 42 of the50 states produce some form ofwheat.  The types of wheat pro-duced vary by climate andgrowing conditions.  Hard wheats are grown inthe northern half of the US.The cold temperatures and dryconditions contribute to theenhanced protein content.  Hard red winter, hard red spring, durum, andhard white wheats are primarily produced west of the Mississippi.Soft wheats are grown predominately east of the Mississippi River.In general, soft wheats are used for baked goods that do notcontainyeast, and hard wheats are used for yeast breads.

The wheat kernel, sometimes called the wheat berry, is the seed fromwhich the wheat plant grows. Each tiny seed contains three distinct partsthat are separated during the milling process to produce flour.The kernelof wheat is a storehouse of nutrients essential to the human diet.BranThe bran contains 14 1/2 percent of the kernel weight.  Bran is includ-ed in whole wheat flour and is also available separately.  Of the nutrientsin whole wheat, the bran contains a small amount of protein, larger quan-tities of the B-complex vita-mins, trace minerals, and indi-gestible cellulose material alsocalled dietary fiber.GermThe germ contains abouttwo and a half percent of thekernel weight.  The germ is theembryo or sprouting section ofthe seed, usually separatedbecause of the fat that limits thekeeping quality of flour.  Of thenutrients in whole wheat, thegerm contains minimal quanti-ties of protein, but a greatershare of B-complex vitamins,Vitamin E, and trace minerals.Wheat germ can be purchasedseparately.EndospermThe endosperm contains 83percent of the kernel weight. Itis the source of white flour.Theendosperm contains the greatestshare of the protein in the wholekernel, carbohydrates, and ironas well as many B-complexvitamins, such as riboflavin,niacin, and thiamine.Refined flour loses between 48-98% of the many naturally occurringvitamins and minerals.  There are estimated to be 26 vitamins and min-erals in a kernel of wheat.  Only Vitamins B-1, B-2, and B-3 and folicacid and iron are added to white flour in a synthetic form, which classi-fies it as \u201cenriched flour\u201d. 1617\n", "doc_id": "9ca9d9d7-24d6-40e5-a9f7-a28ced19954c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e53a1e9b89a1773654a10818418e294e98e9d9ea17b81c4729c17306c1fd9a26", "extra_info": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "12.

Pastry flour is used for baked goods that contain bakingpowder and can be substituted, cup for cup, for all-purpose flour inany recipe.Whole Wheat Flour- Commercially ground whole wheat flour iscoarse-textured and should be stored in the freezer to protect againstrancidity.Whole wheat flour is rich in B-complex vitamins, vitaminE, protein, and contains significantly more trace minerals and dietaryfiber than white flour, however oxidation of the flour  (the combiningof oxygen with nutrients in the flour) results in a tremendous loss ofnutritional content within just a few days.  Fresh milled whole wheatflour is therefore best nutritionally.Hard WinterWheat- Planted in the fall; usually dry-land wheat grownwithout irrigation.  Often grown for animal feed.  Tends to be lowerin protein than hard spring wheat, resulting in lowered performance.Both hard red and hard white winter wheats can be used for yeastbreads.Hard Spring Wheat- Planted in the spring.  Both hard red and hardwhite wheats are grown this way.  It is not irrigated, thus yielding ahigh protein and low moisture content wheat kernel.  This wheattends to be more expensive because of the higher quality protein con-tent and because it is known to make the lightest whole wheat bread.We have found that Montana grown wheat is generally the best qual-ity.  Many husbands and children prefer the milder flavor and lightercolor of hard white wheat made into yeast bread.  Hard white springwheat makes up about 95% of our grain sales.Soft Spring Wheat- Usually this wheat is irrigated.  It has a larger yieldthan hard wheat but is lower in protein.  It is used for making cakescookies, muffins, pancakes, pie crusts, pastries and baked goods thatuse baking powder.When home milling soft wheat, be sure to packfreshly milled pastry flour into a measuring cup, just like whenmeasuring brown sugar, to get accurate measurements.Durum Wheat- Used for making pasta.  Semolina is a refined grade ofmilled Durum wheat used in homemade pasta.Obtaining Whole Grain in BulkBuy grains in bulk, in a 25- or 50-pound bag for the best pricingand convenience.  Store  grain in food grade plastic pails for best econ-omy.The pails are like having the convenience of a grocery storeright in your home.

These lids make access to your grain quite convenient. GammaSeal lids and plastic food grade pails/buckets may also be used over andover for grain storage. Whole grain flours should be used freshly milled.  If you need tostore flour it should be stored in a freezer and used within approximate-ly 3 weeks.

Brown rice should not be stored long-term asit will tend to go rancid after a few months.  Remember the rule ofthumb for food storage: Store what you eat, eat what you store.  Rotate,rotate, rotate!

Basic Ingredients forYeast BreadOnly four ingredients are really essential to making yeast breads:yeast, salt, flour, and water.All other ingredients are optional but mostbakers include additional ingredients in their basic bread recipes such aseggs, oil, honey or sugar for taste, texture, variety,  nutrition, and flavor.Below, I have described the function and purpose of common  ingre-dients found in yeast bread recipes.High quality flourTo get started, purchase or mill the best quality whole wheat flouryou can.  Don\u2019t wait until you get a grain mill.  There is lots to learnabout yeast bread making, so get started now.LiquidsWater, preferably filtered, is the most commonly used liquid in yeastbread, followed by milk.  Fruit juice or combinations of water and milkare also called for in many bread recipes.  Filtered water removes chlo-rine and other contaminants found in tap water.  Filtered water is not onlyhealthier, it also removes contaminants that can interfere with yeastactivity.  Milk adds richness, nutritional value, and flavor to the bread.YeastAlthough there are many brands of yeast available, Ihave found SAF or Fermipan Instant Yeast to be the mostreliable, heat tolerant, concentrated, and economical yeastavailable for bread making.  In fact, both SAF and Fermipanare used by commercial bread makers and institutions. Instant yeast  can be added  directly to the dough mixture withoutproofing, saving time and extra steps.   It is also known as Rapid Rise.Active Dry Yeast is another type of yeast that is widely available andeconomical, but generally has a shorter shelf life and fewer live", "doc_id": "3dbd391a-7ed9-4597-a989-5b43c22972f0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9d7538f31978de81cfc6c3bbafa01ce2bc9e0f3d7a03e29d860b4dfb3d476da2", "extra_info": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "12.

It controls yeastactivity so the bread doesn't rise too quickly and eliminates the \"flat\" tastethat will result if you forget this ingredient.  If you forget to add salt, youwill immediately notice the flat taste of the bread and know instinctivelythat something is missing.  The only bread I have ever thrown awaylacked salt!  Not all salt is the same.  Real Salt\u2122 and some sea salts do not con-tain additives, nor have they been heat processed to excessive tempera-tures.  Check the labels on salt containers for additives, including alu-minum compounds used for anti-caking and avoid such salts.FatsOil or butter produce a more tender crumb or texture in the bread,which also promotes shelf life.  French breads have little or no oil andusually go stale within a day.  Use the highest quality oil or butter you canafford. Expeller pressed oils which require refrigeration have not beenheat processed to high temperatures to make the oil shelf stable.  Expellerpressed oils, extra virgin olive oil (does not require refrigeration), coconutoil, safflower oil, or butter are considered the  healthiest choices.  SweetenersHoney and sugar are the sweeteners that are mostfrequently called for in yeast breads.   Sweetenerspromote yeast activity  by feeding the yeast aswell as enhancing the flavor.  Honey can be sub-stituted, cup for cup, for sugar and I have foundbread made with honey will not stale as quickly.All my yeast bread recipes call for honey.Dough EnhancerThis ingredient does not have a strict definition.  Somedough enhancers are mostly vital gluten while others containingredients (usually natural such as whey,Vitamin C, andlecithin) that increase dough strength, lightness, and shelflife.  This is an optional ingredient that many home bakers have found toimprove the quality of their breads.EggsPrimarily are added to improve the texture and flavor of the bread.Vital GlutenThis optional ingredient really makes a difference inhelping a family transition from refined flour bread to wholegrain bread because it boosts the protein content of the bread(gluten) and strengthens the bread dough, giving the doughthe ability to rise nicely.The resulting bread will be muchsofter, not crumbly, and will rise nicely so the whole grain bread won\u2019tbe heavy or dense.  Unless you are one who prefers heavy dense breads, your husbandand children will appreciate your first whole grain baking experiencesmore if you add vital gluten.  Depending on the quality and protein con-tent of the flour and personal preferences, you may want to use vitalgluten in a recipe. Premium wheats may not need vital gluten.  Agood place to start isto add one half tablespoon vital gluten per cup of flour.Adjust thisamount up or down based on your preference.  Whole grain breads pre-pared in a bread machine require 3-4 table-spoons of vital gluten per loaf, regardless ofthe quality of the wheat.  Nuts, seeds, orgrains otherthan wheatSunflower seeds, flax seeds, and crackedgrains are the most common ingredientsadded to yeast  breads to add nutty andcrunchy appeal, as well as nutritional value.Other grains such as millet, cracked seven grain blend, corn, or oatmealcan be added up to one fourth of the total amount of flour called for in abasic recipe.  Since most of these additions do not contain gluten, thebread will rise more slowly and possibly result in a slightly heavier,chewier product. Compensate by adding a little extra vital gluten.  It isbest to soak the grains or seeds before adding it to the yeast dough.2223\n", "doc_id": "1e931441-29d3-4141-91c2-4778dc14f63c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "24bb76e543afb1d57eadf43c8e6967578641ac18e8d0133bdbd27a81d61e7497", "extra_info": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "12.

Fresh flours taste better and perform much better in whole grainrecipes.2. Fresh flour contains all the vitamins and minerals missing in commer-cial white flours.  It includes the bran which is vital for a healthycolon and weight control.  Fresh flours are also more nutritious thanstore-bought whole grain flours because oxidation of the flours caus-es a great percentage of nutritional loss soon after milling3. Fresh flour is economical!  It only costs about 50\u00a2 to $1.00 per poundwhen freshly milled.4. If you mill only the amount of flour needed, essential nutrients are pre-served.  Within 24 hours up to 40% of the nutrients have oxidized.  Inthree days up to 80% of the nutrients have oxidized.5. Stale flours become rancid because the germ oils in the grain combinewith oxygen in the air when the seed coat is broken.   Rancid oils andflours strain the immune system, speed the aging process and con-tribute free radicals into our bodies.  I have had many people tell methat their bread tastes better after milling it fresh.6. When you mill your flour fresh you may enjoy various grains such asrye, corn, oats, rice, amaranth, spelt, quinoa, and Kamut\u2122, as well asbeans.  Different varieties of flours are good for rotation diets, econ-omy, and for variations in taste.4Selecting AGrain Mill and MixerWhen I purchased my first grain mill, I was the stay-at-home momof a 22-month-old daughter and money was extremely tight.  In fact,before my husband gave his OK for this purchase, he asked me,  \u201cIf I buyyou this grain mill, will you commit to making all of our family\u2019sbread?\u201d Yes, that question threw me for a loopand I had to carefully count the costs and seeif I was that committed or if this was just apassing fancy.  Eventually I said, \u201cYes, I willcommit to baking all our bread.\u201dThat was overtwenty years ago and I have never looked back.Once whole grain is milled into flour, it beginsgoing rancid and loses a significant portion of thenutritional value and baking properties within seven-ty-two hours of milling.  Freshly milled flour should beused within a few hours or frozen for future use. When frozen,it should be used within three weeks.  An added benefit to using freshlymilled flour is the flour temperature is ideal for yeast activity. Bringfrozen flour to room temperature before starting bread making.Maybe you are wondering if you are really willing to commit to bak-ing for your family.  Possibly you have already enjoyed the benefits offreshly milled flour, courtesy of a friend or relative, and you are ready toinvest.  Regardless, you already know that you will be much more satis-fied with your baking results when you are able to use high quality homemilled flour.Electric vs Non-Electric Grain MillsThere are many good electric and non-electric grain mills on themarket in various price ranges.  The advantage of non-electric mills isthat they are quiet to run, usually require a lower initial investment andoffer the ability to adjust the fineness of the flour from fine to coarselycracked.

Usually it takes about fiveminutes of hand cranking to produce one cup of flour, making hand grainmills the ideal choice for emergencies when electricity fails, but they areusually not practical for everyday family use, especially if you are bakingfor a large family.In my 20 years of experience with grain mills, I have found there isno \"perfect\" or \"best\" grain mill that meets all the criteria of every cus-tomer.The \"best\" grain mill, is the mill that meets your personal criteriafor price, noise level, storage space requirements, warranty, and versatil-ity.  Many of the more popular grain mills are used for grains and drybeans and typically should not be used for oily seeds, nuts, or coffee.Following is an outline of the three major categories of grain mills -electric, stone, and micronizer - with a few of theadvantages and disadvantages of each.   Check the manufacturers recom-mendations for what it is designed tomill.Stone MillsStone Mills can be both electric ornon-electric and are capable ofmilling fine flours and will also adjustto produce coarse flour and  crackedgrains.   In general, stone mills are good for milling most grains, butnot dry beans.  The stones need periodic cleaning and ultimately weardown.  Certain grains, like corn, have a tendency to glaze the stoneswhich means the milling stones will need to be cleaned.  Whereas stones were at one time typically mined and cut for millingpurposes, most stones today are produced in factories which use  alu-minum as a binder to hold the stone particles together.  Consider thatstone mills  generally  are heavier in weight and usually take up muchstorage space.  In addition, stone mills tend to be more expensive thanmodern mills that use a newer technology and, depending on thespeed of operation, may heat the flour to higher temperatures anddestroy nutrients.Steel-Cone BurrMillsThis type of grain mill can sometimes be operated by both hand orelectric power and offers the ability to adjust the fineness of the flourfrom fine to cracked.  Generally, the steel-cone burrwill produce flour at a relatively slow speed, but theelectric version is also relatively quiet to run.  Steelcone burr mills can make fine flours suitable forbreads, muffins, pastries, etc, but the flour may notbe as fine as stone or micronizing mills.  T h e s egrain mills can also mill most whole grains andbeans, but larger grains such as corn and beans willneed to be cracked first, and then run through again on a fine settingif you want flour.  Examples include the Family Grain Mill, Back toBasics hand mill, Jupiter Grain Mill, and Kitchen Aid Grain Mill.Micronizing Grain MillsMicronizing mills are exclusively powered by electricity and utilizetechnology that originally was developed for the pharmaceuticalindustry to derive fine, uniform powders.  Modifiedfor milling grains, micronizers are fast and capable ofmilling grains into very fine, powdery flour at lowtemperatures.  These mills tend to be louderand may take up more space than some ofthe previously mentioned mills.  Althoughthey will mill a wide variety of dry grainsand dry beans, they generally will only milla range of flours from very fine toslightly coarse as in cornmeal.  My per-sonal preference and baking experiencehas been exclusively with micronizing grain mills.Micronizing mills include The Kitchen Mill,Wonder Mill, and NutriMill.Selecting AMixerRather than hand mixing and kneading, many homebakers prefer tolet the mixing and kneading of bread be done with a mixer.Wholegrain bread dough is quite heavy and can easily burn out low poweredmixers, hand mixers, and food processors in a short period of time.The first heavy duty  mixer I ever saw was owned by a gal who proud-ly told me she  burned out three food processors before investing in thecurrent mixer which", "doc_id": "19eaeaf6-f613-4c34-8bd3-85068af7e77d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6dd6515f7c3e1e3ce6bb7327cbed98508a9030c3d770fdd4d80b10c5f8c8a815", "extra_info": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "12.

Allow to sponge for 15 minutes.  Add thehoney, oil, dough enhancer, salt and 4-5 cups  additional flour until thedough begins to clean the sides of the mixing bowl.  This is truewhether you are mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or using adough hook attachment with an electric mixer.Knead the bread by hand 7-10 minutes or until it is very smooth, elas-tic, and small bubbles or blisters appear beneath the surface of thedough.   It is a common mistake of beginners to add too much flour.When hand kneading, oil your kneading surface and your hands with1-2 tsp of oil to help reduce stickiness to avoid adding too much flour.Form the dough into 2 loaves.Allow the dough to rise in a slight-ly warmed oven or other warmplace until doubled in size, about30-60 minutes.  (Turn the oven onfor 5-10 minutes, turn off oven andopen door, allowing it to cool downto approx. 100\u00b0F.Then put thedough in the warmed oven andclose the oven door.)  Bake the loaves for 25-30 minutes at 350\u00b0F.  Preheating the oven is notnecessary.  Bread is done when the top, sides, and bottom are nicelybrowned in color, or 180\u00b0F to 200\u00b0F is reached on an instant-read ther-mometer.  Over baked is better than under baked.General Mixing Tips and Suggestions* Use warm water.  Best temperature is 110 - 120\u00b0F if using SAFInstant Yeast, otherwise 110\u00b0F maximum.  If you are not using Instant orQuick Rising Yeast like SAF, be sure to proof the yeast before using it bymixing the yeast with 1/2 cup warm water with a teaspoon of sugar orhoney and allowing it to sit for 10 minutes before using it.* Use the right amount of flour.Too much flour kneaded into thedough causes dry crumbly bread.  Because the moisture content of floursvary, yeast bread recipes will always call for a range of flour.With expe-rience you will learn to recognize when the right amount of flour has beenadded to the dough rather than relying on measurements alone. * Sponging is simply allowing the dough to sit in the mixing bowl toallow the flour to absorb the liquid.  Combine the warm water, yeast, and2 cups of fresh whole wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. Allow to spongefor 15 minutes.  This step gets the yeast off to a good start.  Set the timerif necessary.  Use the \u201cwaiting time\u201d to clean up your kitchen or fold thelaundry.  Don\u2019t worry if the sponge goes longer than 15 minutes.  The artof baking bread is flexible.  If the baby needs to be changed, or the mail-man rings the door bell, and life happens, relax; get back to the bread assoon as you can and don\u2019t fret.* Measure ingredients and mix the dough.  Measure the oil into aglass measuring cup before the honey.That way the honey slides out withminimal stickiness.  Then add the remaining ingredients and 4-5 cupsadditional flour.  Stir with a sturdy wooden spoon until the bread doughbegins to clean the sides of the mixing bowl.

Assemble yourbasic yeast bread ingredients:fresh whole wheat flour,salt, yeast, honey, vital gluten and filtered water.You are ready to get started!Step 2: Mixing the ingredientsPour the water into a mixing bowl and stir in the dry ingredients witha wooden spoon until they are moistened.  There is really no perfect orderfor combining these ingredients but below are some tips for insuring goodsuccess with your first efforts at baking whole grain bread. Step 3 through8 below will describe the kneading, rising, shaping, baking, and coolingsteps in more detail.Step 3: Knead the doughThis process will develop the gluten.The gluten is an elastic protein thatenables dough to hold it\u2019s shape whenraised.  The most difficult aspect of mas-tering bread baking is learning thekneading technique and knowing howlong to knead.  Here is how to recognizewhen the gluten is fully developed:  Thedough will be smooth and elastic.  Take a golf ball sized portion of doughand see if the dough is stretchy and does not readily tear.Add vital glutento improve the gluten content and texture of your bread.Tips forKneading the Dough By HandTry to get all the flour incorporated within two minutes of mixing soyou will have even gluten development.  Too little flour will cause thedough to be too sticky to work with, which is your signal to add moreflour.  Since whole grain flour absorbs moisture more slowly, be sure notto add too much flour, or, as you mix and knead, the dough will becometoo dry, resulting in crumbly bread.  Add more flour gradually, in 1/2- 1cup portions.  It takes practice to add the right amount.Arhythmic process called \u201ckneading\u201ddevelops the gluten in the  bread dough bystraightening the gluten strands and causingthem to become smooth and elastic.   Placethe slightly flattened dough all onto a light-ly floured surface, and fold the dough  overtoward yourself.  Press the folded dought o g e t h e r, pushing down and away fromyourself with the lightly floured heels ofboth hands.Give the dough a quarter turnand repeat the process by folding the doughand pressing away, turning and repeating.This \u201ckneading\u201d is a rhythmic motion, repeated many times. Knead the dough by hand 7-10 minutes or until it is very smooth,elastic, and small bubbles or blisters appear beneath the surface of thedough.  It is a common mistake for beginners to add too much flour.When hand kneading, if you will oil your kneading surface and yourhands with 1-2 tsp of oil, this will reduce stickiness and help you avoidadding too much flour.   If your dough is too sticky to work with afteroiling your hands you will need to gradually add additional flour.AFool-Proof Way to Knead YourBreadAn older, wiser woman told me how she determined if her bread wasadequately kneaded.  She said, \u201cSay the Lord\u2019s Prayer as you knead,making one kneading stroke per word and then repeating the prayer atleast twice.\u201dMany ladies have told me that this method alone solvedtheir dilemma of determining how long to knead the dough.With experience you will eventually master the kneading processand learn to \u201cfeel\u201d and recognize when the gluten is developed.Step 4: Recognizing When The Gluten Is DevelopedYou can recognize when gluten is fully developed by taking a golfball sized portion of dough and gently stretching the dough in oppositedirections using your thumb and forefinger of both hands.  If you canstretch the dough thin enough to see light through without the doughreadily tearing, you have sufficiently", "doc_id": "6a3b9708-6444-44cd-a215-d4213c3b5597", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ea1a0604ac935876266ac30537de3bed03af9141c8f451917026332cf9bea003", "extra_info": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "12.

More kneading after a certain point does not mean more glutendevelopment.  In fact, it is possible to over-knead the dough and, if thisdoes occur, the gluten begins to break down and the dough becomes asticky mess. Finish making the bread according to the instructions below.The fin-ished bread may be a bit heavier and denser than you like,  but I suspectthe bread you have made will smell wonderful and be delicious even if itis a bit heavy and dense.  Just view this as a \u201clearning experience.\u201d   As I have said before, thereare no failures in bread baking, only learning experiences.  Expect to havethem.   Bread that we call a learning experience is usually enjoyed by thefamily anyway, or it can be salvaged by turning the baked bread into crou-tons, bread pudding, bread crumbs, or feeding the ducks.If you find your bread heavier or denser than you and your familyenjoy,  you will want to add vital gluten into the recipe next time toimprove the texture of the bread.   Often, baking with Montana grownhard wheat (which is higher in protein content) may solve thatheavy/dense bread problem in the future.Step 5: Let The Dough Rise(1st raising - optional)When the gluten is fully developed, allow the dough to rise in agreased mixing bowl.  Cover the dough with a damp kitchen towel tokeep the dough from drying out.  This step is often called \u201cproofing\u201d (notto be confused with proofing the yeast).  Proofing is a baking term forallowing bread dough to raise, generally  outside of the oven.  Althoughthis step is optional, proofing will develop texture and flavor, glutenframework, and help make light, fluffy loaves of whole wheat bread.  Ifyou are in a hurry, this step can be skipped.The activity of the yeast ferments the flour, causing the developmentof carbon dioxide gas to develop.  The carbon dioxide is captured by thegluten which raises the bread.  The optimum temperature for yeast activity is 85-100\u00b0F so use aslightly warmed oven, top of the refrigerator, direct sunlight or any otherwarm place, if possible.  Otherwise, the first rising period done at roomtemperature will just take longer, which is nothing to be concerned about.Normally the first rising period  takes about 30-60 minutes.  (The firstrising of the bread can be skipped if you are in a hurry, but flavor andtexture of the bread improve with up to three risings.)  After the dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough, divideit into two equal pieces and shape the loaves.  Use 1 tsp. oil on yourkneading surface or on your hands when it is time to shape the dough.This keeps the dough from sticking and avoids using excess flour.Step 6: Shaping bread loavesAfter the dough has risen once and been punched down with yourfist (this deflates all the air bubbles), you will want to shape the loavesin a round cylindrical loaf shape the length of your bread pan.  It isimportant to get all the air bubbles out of the dough before shaping.  Thiscan be done by banging the dough a few times firmly on the counter.Make sure the loaf is nice and round and smooth before placing inloaf pans.  When I\u2019m content with the shape of my loaf, I put the dough,smooth side on top, into the greased bread pans and lightly grease the topof the loaf with oil or melted butter.  For the prettiest highest rising breadloaves, use 8\u201dx4 1/2\u201d loaf pans filled 1/2 to 2/3 full of bread dough.

Oncethis basic dough is prepared, you can fashion it into a wide variety ofbaked goods such as pizza, cinnamon rolls, bread sticks, onion cheesebread, and more!  Read on for a dozen or so of my ideas.  With practiceyou can create your own variations.Whole Wheat PizzaUse approximately one loaf of bread dough (11/2 pounds dough) for each pizza crust.  Ifyou are not baking the crust on a pizza stone,you will be much more successful if you pre-bake the crust for six to eight minutes at350\u00b0F, and then cover it with toppings of yourchoice.  Pre-baked crusts must be forked all over to release steamwhile baking.  Be sure to have all your toppings ready, or wrap andfreeze pizza crusts for future meals.Cinnamon Pull-ApartsPinch dough off into walnut-sized balls.  Dip in melted butter andthen roll in cinnamon sugar mixture (1 tablespoon cinnamon to 1/2cup sugar or Sucanat).  Place balls in layers (at least two layers deepor fill the pan one half to two thirds full) in a baking pan or bundtpan.  Let rise until doubled in bulk, then bake at 350\u00b0F for 25-30minutes.Caramel Nut Pull-ApartsMake caramel sauce by melting 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar,and 1/2 cup maple syrup in a saucepan. Add 1/2 cup chopped wal-nuts or pecans if desired.  Pour this mixture into the bottom of abundt pan or baking pan.  Place walnut-sized pieces of dough in lay-ers in the pan.

Avery hot oven is the key to forming the pockets.  If you have a pizza stone,by all means use it but make sure it is thoroughly pre-heated, otherwisean ungreased cookie sheet works, too.  Wrap baked pitas in a large terrycloth towel, directly after removing themfrom the oven.  While still warm, store in plastic bags.  They will contin-ue to soften up.  Then cut in half with your kitchen shears.Pita Bread Tips:1. A2 1/4\u201d dough ball equals about 1/4 cup dough.  Put the ball on afloured board and turn it over to coat both sides.  Using the large endof a pizza roller, begin rolling and turning the dough ball, to make anice round flat shape, about 1/8 inch thick.  (Apizza roller is a smallrolling tool that has a roller on each end.  It is easy to use because ofthe small size.)  As each pita is shaped, let it rise at least five minuteson the counter top.2. Bake four pitas at a time.3. Apizza stone is imperative if you want your breads to puff.  Apizzapeel is a wonderful tool to use for sliding the pitas from counter tocookie sheet or pizza stone.4. Leave the oven door closed until the pitas are done.  Opening the doorwhile baking will keep the pitas from puffing.\n6061\n", "doc_id": "533d7d39-5ed2-4887-b142-5ec1cee8420e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0b58d9a0dc9538701fbfe75c83feef3574285d93a7cd1b0ef3c9d3baed204c85", "extra_info": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "12.

Low pro-tein means low gluten content.  All wheat is not created equal, andpremium wheat will have a  higher protein content than less expen-sive wheat.  (Review Chapter 3, Know Your Basic Ingredients.) If you are using a low protein wheat, make a note to add vitalgluten to the bread dough in your next baking session to boost upthe gluten content.  Use 1 tablespoon vital gluten per cup of flouras a starting place.  You can increase or decrease the amount toyour preference with subsequent baking sessions. Another optionis  to use one to two cups of bread flour in place of whole wheatflour.Sometimes the cause of poorly risen bread is bad or weak yeast.  Ifyou suspect your yeast is out of date or old, here is how to proof(test) the yeast:  In a cup, add 1 teaspoon yeast to 1/2 cup warmwater (85\u00b0F) and 1 teaspoon sugar.  If the yeast isn\u2019t bubbling upto the top of the cup within 10 minutes, replace the yeast.Be sure to store yeast cool and dry.  Use moisture/vapor proof con-tainers.  I use a pint-sized canning jar and store the yeast in thefreezer.The yeast can be used in recipes straight from the freezer.Another possible reason for bread not rising well is underdevel-oped gluten.  Learn to recognize when the gluten is fully devel-oped.

Solution:When loaves sink in the middle, it means the bread structureis weak, and the bread has been over-risen.  Shorten the rising time.Whole grain loaves should only double in volume before beingready to bake.  Also, consider if you are using larger than ideal loaf pans.  Wholegrain breads rise best in narrower pans, 8\u201dx4\u201d pans are ideal.  Thenarrower width makes for higher rising loaves.  Wider pans, such as9\u201dx5\u201d, make loaves that spread more than rise.  It isn\u2019t wrong to usethe larger pans, but the results are not the same; my philosophy is touse what you have.Problem:My bread keeps turning out dry, even when I don\u2019t put asmuch flour in.  I get it to where it is a workable dough  and the bread isstill dry.Solution:  If the bread is still dry and you know you have been careful tonot add too much flour, you probably have low protein wheat.  Thesolution is to add vital gluten which adds moistness and improvesthe texture of the bread.  Start with 1/3 cup vital gluten for a twoloaf batch.  Increase or decrease the amount of vital gluten accord-ing to your taste preferences in subsequent baking sessions.Problem:I don\u2019t eat wheat anymore due to severe gluten-sensitivity.  Doyou have any good gluten-free bread recipes?Solution:There is a body of scientific research mentioned in theSummer 2006 edition of Wise Traditions Journalpublished byWeston A. Price Foundation that soaking the gluten containing grainsfirst for 12-24 hours will eliminate the gluten intolerance problem.(This journal can be purchased at www.westonaprice.org.)During the soaking process, enzymes, lactobacilli and other helpfulorganisms not only neutralize phytic acids (substances that interferewith digestion) but also break down complex starches and difficult-to-digest proteins, including gluten.  There are many testimonials of people using this soaking method torecover their health without total dependence on a gluten-free diet.Problem:I am having trouble with making bread dough in my mixer.The dough is always very sticky and I can\u2019t seem to get the textureright.  Solution:If the dough is sticky there is not enough flour.The trick tosuccess in a mixer is to add enough flour so the dough \u201ccleans thesides\u201d of the mixing bowl.  Then add a little extra flour (1/2 to 1cup). Remember to try and incorporate all the flour  in about twominutes of mixing time for even gluten development.  Begin to timethe kneading once the bread starts cleaning the sides of the mixingbowl.Remember, the amount of flour called for in ANYbread recipe is aguide.  Moisture content in flour varies depending on humidity andweather conditions.  The key is to add enough flour until the doughpulls away from the sides of the bowl.  It is less important to accu-rately measure the amount of flour in yeast breads, and more impor-tant to get the right texture/dryness.Keep in mind that whole grain flour absorbs moisture slowly;  some-times you will need to add a little extra flour in the beginning to com-pensate so the dough doesn\u2019t get so sticky you can\u2019t work with it.If your dough never gets elastic and you are kneading properly, theproblem is either low protein/quality wheat or it has been overknead-ed.  If bread is kneaded more than 10-12 minutes it may beoverkneaded, at which point the gluten starts to break down.The goal is to make the dough smooth and elastic and easily handled.Practice makes perfect.

The only adjustment I make isadding some vital gluten so the bread will not be too dense or heavyor dry.Problem:  My bread is dry and crumbly, and doesn\u2019t slice well.Solution:  Make sure you don\u2019t add too much flour during the kneadingprocess.  Sometimes low protein wheat results in dry bread.  Addingvital gluten helps \u201clighten\u201d the bread and make it softer.Add vitalgluten, starting with 1/3 cup per 2 loaf batch and increase the quanti-ty if needed.Sometimes over-risen bread will have a very coarse texture and does-n\u2019t slice well.  Reduce the rising time; make sure the dough only dou-bles in size before baking.I have found the Two-Stage Process (see Chapter 9), in which theflour is soaked for 12-24 hours before preparing the bread loaves,makes much moister bread.  Also, the use of honey  instead of sugarwill result in moister bread that does not readily go stale.9The Two-Stage ProcessDoes it make a difference and why? The two-stage process is a term coined by Sue Gregg, author of SueGregg Cookbooks, for a method of preparing yeast breads in which thegrain or flour is soaked, sprouted, or fermented for a period of time priorto kneading the dough in order to maximize the nutritional value ofwhole grain bread. Soaking, sprouting, or fermenting the flour or grain are methodsused traditionally by our ancestors for preparing grains, porridges, orbreads.  These slower, more gentle methods contrast sharply with mod-ern factory and commercial baking techniques.  Only recently hasresearch documented the chemical changes that occur using these slow-er methods and the corresponding health benefits. According to Sally Fallon and Dr. Mary Enig, in their bookNourishing Traditions, enzyme inhibitors, tannins, complex sugars, dif-ficult to digest proteins, \u201canti-nutrients\u201d (substances which put a strainon our digestive system and pancreas), and other factors in whole grainscontribute to a variety of digestive disorders.  It has been hypothesizedthat improperly prepared whole grains, consumed for a long period oftime, may contribute to increasing incidences of gluten intolerance, grainallergies, celiac  disease, chronic indigestion, mineral deficiencies, andbone loss. The slow process of soaking flour or whole grains in an acidic envi-ronment neutralizes phytic acid, which is contained in the bran and whichblocks absorption of minerals, significantly boosting the availability ofvitamin and mineral content to the body.  The authors  point out that,\u201c Tannins, complex sugars, gluten and other difficult-to-digest substancesare partially broken down into simpler components that are more readilyavailable for absorption\u201dduring the soaking, sprouting, or fermentingprocess.

(Many of our senior citizens may remember that in earliertimes the instructions on the oatmeal box called for an overnightsoaking)\u201d (pg. 452).My bread recipes do not reflect the two-stage process because Iencourage beginning bakers to master the basics of yeast bread makingbefore undertaking this soaking, sprouting, or fermenting method. Although I had started making fermented bread with a wild-caughtsour dough starter several years ago (one of the methods mentioned inNourishing Traditions), I found the very slow rising time resulted in verysour bread and the very long raising time was often not compatible withmy busy schedule.  Sue Gregg introduced me to the Two-Stage Processwhich I find works well with my schedule; in fact, I would consider thismethod somewhat of a convenience.  Bread that has been made using the two-stage process is moister forlonger periods of time, and stales very slowly.  Many people with healthissues such as sinus problems, gluten intolerance, and allergies havereported that symptoms have been relieved when using the two-stageprocess.TWO-STAGE PROCESS FOR YEASTBREADSAdapting Marilyn's Famous Whole Wheat Bread Recipe to MaximizeNutritional Value 1. Soak the whole grain flour in liquid, using 1 tablespoon of an \u201cacid\u201dmedium such as kefir, yogurt, buttermilk or whey for each cup ofwater called for in Marilyn's Bread Recipe.  For example, if a recipecalls for 6 cups water, use 6 tablespoons kefir, yogurt or buttermilkalong with the water.You can substitute  lemon juice or vinegarinstead if you suspect dairy intolerance.  Add the honey and oil called for in the recipe along with enough flourto make a thick batter.  Mix the liquid and flour ingredients only untilmoistened and then begin the \u201csoaking\u201d time.  Soaking/fermentationtime is done at room temperature.  For the Hand Method, use aboutfive to six cups whole grain flour.  Use 11-12 cups flour for the LargeMixer method. Twelve to 24 hours or more soaking time will yield the best results.The longer you soak the flour the more sour dough-like taste it willhave.  However, be flexible; soak the flour for as long as you havetime so that this process fits into your routine smoothly; any soakingtime improves texture, nutrition, and flavor.  Just mix the liquid andwater long enough to moisten the flour before the soaking timebegins.  This is a little bit like \"sponging\" however no yeast is used.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp cloth to prevent it fromdrying out. 2.

This two-stage procedure can be used with any yeast bread recipe.   I have received many positive testimonials about the two-stage processfrom experienced bakers.  Here is what one mom said about her experi-ence:\u201cI decided to try the 2-stage process for making your famous bread.  I LOVED it!  The bread was so light, you wouldn't knowit has mostly whole wheat flour in it!  My family hasn't reallyliked the all whole wheat bread I've made before because it wasso heavy and dry.  But doing the 2-stage process helps it be somuch moister and lighter!  I just wanted to share that I tried yourrecipe and we love it!  Thanks!!!!\u201dSheri Graham, KSConclusion When you have learned to use a variety of whole grains in your diet,and your family has accepted this change, then you might want to con-sider moving on to the new step of adapting your recipes to the two-stageprocess.  Sue Gregg writes in An Introduction To Whole Grain Baking, \u201cI sug-gest that occasional consumption of whole grains that are not processedby one of the three two-stage methods (soaking, fermenting, sprouting)is not likely detrimental to health and may contribute a plus, while thosethat are properly processed as the main dietary choice will be greatlybeneficial to health.\" (p. 14)Learning to prepare breads and grain products with slower methodsmay seem daunting or a bit intimidating or even overwhelming to abeginning baker just becoming acquainted with whole grains.

They also may help prevent cancer. \nBesides being nutritious, almond flour is also delicious, with a flavor and texture that \nadds not only moisture, but an extra dimension of taste to dishes it's used in. \nPopular uses for almond flour include piecrusts, cakes, pancakes , cookies, and other \nbaked goods. It is also often used as a substitute for breadcrumbs, such as when \nmaking meatballs or coating fish or chicken, or as a thickener in soups and stews. \nAlmond flour is also tasty when used for crackers and for \"crumbles\" over fruit cobblers \n(sugar, butter, and a cup of almond flour combined and crumbled over cobbler before \nbaking). \nAlmond flour is so nutritious and delicious, that many people sprinkle it over dessert \nitems such as ice cream, just to get every bit of nutrition and taste they can out of wh at \nthey eat. \nAlmond Flour Tips  \n\uf0b7 Almond flour is best kept refrigerated or frozen \u2014just make sure you let it thaw \nout before you use it. If you store it in the refrigerator or freezer, it will keep for 6 \nmonths. \n\uf0b7 If there is one down side to almond flour, it may be the cost. While it can get ve ry \nexpensive when you buy it in the store, buying it online  will save you a little \nmoney. \n\uf0b7 If you've never made anything with almond flour before, you might want to start \noff with a recipe that specifically calls for almond flour. However, if you're anxious \nto try a \"regular\" recipe with almond flour substituted, you can try a direct \nsubstitution (i.e., a cup of almond flour for a cup of whole flour). Just be \nprepared \u2014it might not come out exactly as you hoped, and you might have to try \na bit of experimentation to get the exact results you want. \n\uf0b7 Baked goods made with almond flour are a little more delicate than your typical \nbaked goods. Let them sit for a few minutes after baking before you try to get \nthem out of the muffin tin or off of the pan. \nNow that you know how good almond flour can be \u2014and how good it can be for you \u2014\nhow about a tasty recipe that uses some?

Sure, at first it seems like a secr et, \nbut really, it\u2019s all about the technique you use for your particular biscuit recipe.  \nFlaky and buttery, fluffy and moist, these are all terms bakers and foodies use to \ndescribe their ideal biscuit. But can a gluten free biscuit also have these qualities? \nAbsolutely yes. It just takes a bit of trial and experimentation with flours to get the  \nperfect gluten free biscuit  to compliment your meal. \nThese \u201csecrets\u201d that I\u2019m revealing are not so much secrets as lessons. There are things \nto do and things not to do. But they are all little techniques to help your gluten f ree \nbiscuits rise to the occasio n. \nSecret # 1  \nThe type of flour you use determines the outcome of your finished product. Sounds like \na no-brainer, right? Well this is vitally important for baking gluten free. For example, if \nyou want fluffy, white biscuits, as opposed to a brownish color, use superfine white rice \nflour. Brown rice flour can also be used, but they will have a hint of brown. Coconut flour \nlends a great taste to biscuits, but may be a little too sweet for a dinner meal.\n \nSecret # 2  \nThe gums that gluten free baking usually require are not always necessary in biscuit \nrecipes. Often, your biscuits will turn out just spectacular with a combination of some \nbaking powder and salt mixed with gluten free four and starch. This may not be th e case \nfor every recipe, but for a general rule of thumb, xanthan gum and guar gum can often \nbe omitted . \nSecret # 3  \nThe type of fat you use can make a world of difference in your biscuits. This is regarding \ntaste and even texture sometimes. Butter is going to result in a buttery, almost sweet \ntaste in your biscuits. Shortening can also be used \u2013 it\u2019s going to lend more height to \n", "doc_id": "c66fceb3-199a-466d-8918-1af21830d028", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "de6c832fb58488dfb9aa1d2ecfbfec936dcf53a24791693a1d7a5bdd24d99a26", "extra_info": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "02. 15 Gluten Free Bread Recipes to Bake, Roll and Sweet Bread Your Way into the Holidays author Gluten-Free-Bread.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1896, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "13eac800-d3ca-40b8-9eb3-e5e37899b260"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea84e05e-08eb-4cfc-b433-f3519c19ea15": {"__data__": {"text": "12 \n\u00a9 2014 www.Gluten-Free-Bread.org  All Rights Reserved. \n your biscuits and they may also be softer. Shortening is flavorless so the end result will \ntaste a bit different than your butter counterparts. The final verdict between the two is if \nthe recipe calls for butter or margarine, use the butter option. If the recipe calls for any \ntype of fat (as in, it gives you options), choose the one that will compliment the rest o f \nthe meal best. \nSecret # 4  \nYou don\u2019t have to make drop biscuits. This is a little secret I discovered while multi -\ntasking. Just because the recipe is directing you to drop the biscuits on the cookie sheet \ndoesn\u2019t mean you have to. Instead, if you prefer round, cookie -cutter biscuits, make \nthose instead. The secret is that because gluten free biscuit dough will be quite sticky, \nyou\u2019ll have to do some creative positioning. Take a piece of plastic wrap and dust a little \nflour on it. Lay your biscuit dough on it and cover it with another piece of plastic wrap. \n(You might need a little more flour). Gently roll out the dough to a nice thickness \u2013 about \n\u00bd inch or so. Use a floured cookie cutter  to cut out your biscuits. Slide a metal spatula \nunderneath the dough and place your biscuits on the baking sheet. A nice, easy way  to \nget beautiful round biscuits! \nSecret # 5  \nPlacing the biscuits close to each other helps them rise higher. However, in most biscuit \nrecipes, not just the gluten free ones, the directions state to place the biscuits 2 inches a \npart to bake. Well, if you want to see some nicely risen biscuits, try placing them closer \nto each other. Allow them some space, but if you try for about \u00bd inch apart, they w ill be \nable to grab onto the other biscuits, thus baking up sky high and light. \nWhether you like light and fluffy or tall and flaky biscuits, your gluten free baking  \nadventures just got even more interesting with these secrets to yummy biscuits. Th e \ngreat thing about biscuits is that adding cheese or herbs can take a basic, plain biscuit \nand transform it into a savory gluten free bread  worthy of serving to guests. Or add in \nsome cinnamon and serve them with honey butter and you have a delightf ully delicious \nbreakfast treat. \nEnjoy your biscuits! \nLike this article?

Gluten Free sourdough bread actually has significant health benefits because \nit is easier to digest than ordinary breads; the proteins are already partially broken down \nbefore the bread even hits your digestive system. It also helps keep your blood sug ar in \ncheck by not causing the spike that other types of bread do. \nThe secret behind the bread\u2019s uniq ue flavor lies in fermenting the flour in a sourdough \nstarter that you can keep for as long as you want to keep feeding it. However, not a ny \nflour can be used to make this type of bread, in part because of the wide variety of \nflavors available, but mostly because of their starch levels. \nIt is necessary to use a flour mix that has a good ratio of protein to starches  in order to \nproduce bread that has a nice, fluffy texture and that doesn\u2019t fall apart. Another \nalternative to mixing your own flour is to buy it pre-mixed, a good idea for beginners to \nGluten Free bread baking. \n", "doc_id": "be79b909-6377-41cc-a7ef-8a940dd3f7af", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e48bb75b9d72693fdecee3d77545618b320dab8c890a456b6f54184cf64b6b38", "extra_info": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "02. 15 Gluten Free Bread Recipes to Bake, Roll and Sweet Bread Your Way into the Holidays author Gluten-Free-Bread.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1245, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "f7aca628-dbfe-4086-8b2c-6f12135ddf38"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8d75ceb-6773-4dd9-87e1-e8044d9f4c69": {"__data__": {"text": "16 \n\u00a9 2014 www.Gluten-Free-Bread.org  All Rights Reserved. \n The Sourdough Starter  \nEvery loaf of sourdough begins with a starter. You make this flour-and-water \ncombination ahead of time and let it sit in your fridge until the flour has suffici ently \nfermented, and this is the base of the bread that adds that tangy taste we a ll love. \nThe process takes about 5 \u20137 days, but once your starter is ready you can continue to \nfeed it and it will be ready- to-go whenever the mood strikes you to make another loaf of \nbread. \nTo make it, simply whisk together \u00bd cup of Gluten Free flour mix with \u00bd cup water in a \nnon-metal bowl or wide-mouthed jar and put it in the fridge. Then, over the ne xt 5\u20137 \ndays you\u2019ll add \u00bd cup of the flour and a 1/2 water about twice per day at regular \nintervals. \nWatch the starter as you continue to feed it; after about three days after you be gin the \nstarter, bubbles should begin to form around the top and sides of the mixture. If  you do \nnot have bubbles, you will need to start feeding the starter three times pe r day, still at \nregular intervals. \nYou will be able to tell that you sourdough starter is ready when it forms a n ice round \ndome within about three hours of your feeding it. At this point you can make your loaf.  \nIt can seem like a long process at first, but don\u2019t worry\u2014 a nice loaf of fresh sourdough \nbread is definitely worth the effort. \nMaking the Bread  \nWhen your starter is nicely fermented, you can make your first loaf of sourdough. Many \nGluten Free bread bakers understand that since Gluten Free flour can be trickier than \nwheat flour, beginners may not get the results that they are looking for on the first t ry. \nDon\u2019t let this discourage you though, just continue to feed your starter and try again.  \nIngredients:  \n2 cups Gluten Free flour mix \n\u00bc teaspoon cream of tartar \n\u00bc cup sugar \n1 teaspoon salt \n2 teaspoons active dry yeast \n2 cups sourdough starter \n3 tablespoons butter, melted (or any oil of your choice) \n1 \u00bd cup milk, heated to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit \nDirections:  ", "doc_id": "e8d75ceb-6773-4dd9-87e1-e8044d9f4c69", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "eb5ecf8baef0da0341e46d45fd6bb02c27e8d616358324e2cf6062876f3370ec", "extra_info": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "02. 15 Gluten Free Bread Recipes to Bake, Roll and Sweet Bread Your Way into the Holidays author Gluten-Free-Bread.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2063, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "eee7ad52-3db5-4a52-93ca-d3ef24b51fe8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcee6523-62ef-47b0-ad45-24141cc25f14": {"__data__": {"text": "17 \n\u00a9 2014 www.Gluten-Free-Bread.org  All Rights Reserved. \n 1.

Although all the ingredients \nmay seem like they would make a great cornbread, and many of them are very similar, \nsometimes the smallest thing can make a big impact. For instance, did you know if you \nput your baking pan in the preheating oven for a few minutes it gives your cornbread a \nnice crusty bottom and sides? And if you let your batter rest for a minute, it make s the \ntop rise nicely? Its things like that that can take your cornbread from ho-hum to Wow ! \nGluten free cornbread is another story though. If you\u2019ve made it unsuccessfully before, \nthen these terms should be familiar - dryness, grittiness, general lack of taste. \nSometimes even adding more butter doesn\u2019t help. Fortunately, there is hope. There are \nsome things you can do to create the best, most springy gluten free cornbread in the \nworld \u2013 and no one will even know its gluten free! \nRemember to preheat your oven.  \nPreheating is important as it ensures your oven is at just the right temperature before \nyou put your labor of love in there to bake. And, going a step further, if you want a nice \ncrisp to your gluten free cornbread, then preheat your pan as well. \nFat is a good thing.  \nFat and cornbread go together like cinnamon and cinnamon rolls \u2013 you can\u2019t have one \nwithout the other. Some form of fat is essential for a nice, moist cornbread. Now, the re \nare some exceptions to this rule \u2013 there are recipes that are low-fat by design. In this \ncase, the fat has been replaced by something else. I may be premature here, but I\u2019ve \nnever found a low-fat gluten free cornbread recipe that tastes like this one. \nDon\u2019t get overzealous with the mixing.  \nEven though your gluten free recipes can\u2019t get tough due to overworking the g luten, \nthey can still get tough due to over-mixing.

The white part of the peel is quite bite r \nand could offset the sweetness of the muffin. \n", "doc_id": "453d25e9-1439-41e3-a381-8aeaea576c09", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e67b781be9848f8d23c2b4920cbabbc5ef3139ccdd3f8d079224db7cfbde06cd", "extra_info": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "02. 15 Gluten Free Bread Recipes to Bake, Roll and Sweet Bread Your Way into the Holidays author Gluten-Free-Bread.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1314, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ce973b8c-722b-4409-b2b6-52fd4bd2ebc3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "49cca3f0-5f57-4b6d-9fb2-1a80e270e551": {"__data__": {"text": "32 \n\u00a9 2014 www.Gluten-Free-Bread.org  All Rights Reserved. \n Gluten Free Lemon Cranberry Muffins  \nIngredients:  \n\uf0b7 1 cup organic cranberries, minced \n\uf0b7 6 eggs \n\uf0b7 1 tsp lemon zest \n\uf0b7 1 Tbsp. lemon juice \n\uf0b7 1/2 cup coconut oil \n\uf0b7 6 Tbsp. maple syrup \n\uf0b7 1/2 cup coconut flour, sifted \n\uf0b7 1/2 tsp baking soda \nDirections:  \n1.

It\u2019s easily the most popular binding agent and most Gluten Free \nrecipes feature it as a crucial ingredient. \nHowever, recently, there has been some controversy surrounding xanthan gum as it \nappears to cause allergy-like symptoms in certain individuals. Add that to the fact that \nit\u2019s highly processed, its use is being viewed as contradictory to the healthy and hol istic \napproach that is sometimes embraced by Gluten Free bakers. \nSo it leaves us with a problem or perhaps a challenge. Are there alternatives to xanthan \nand if so, how can you use them in your baking to perhaps avoid the negative  health \neffects that using xanthan may bring? We\u2019ll look at some alternatives in this article.  \nChia Seeds \nChia seeds are an excellent binding agent and can absorb up to 12 times their own \nweight in water. They form a gel-like substance which improves the consistency of \ndough and locks in moisture when baking breads, pastries and cakes. \nThey can be ground, although this is not necessary for the binding effect to take pl ace. \nChia seeds are also extremely high in fiber and can have a laxative effect. They are \npopular replacements for xanthan gum  because while they have a nutty flavor, it\u2019s mild \nand tends not to interfere with the flavor of the baked goods they are add ed to. \n", "doc_id": "fa38ac8f-3373-47b2-a952-71264c9933da", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4711a98fdd1f4a856dea21c759343dd980681f1ae26e528c8e08e16f8ae21262", "extra_info": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "02. 15 Gluten Free Bread Recipes to Bake, Roll and Sweet Bread Your Way into the Holidays author Gluten-Free-Bread.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1518, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "7925f219-9446-4c36-9a77-dc3fa9ae8547"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8df522f-5618-4fe3-b40e-a0bc67e186fa": {"__data__": {"text": "45 \n\u00a9 2014 www.Gluten-Free-Bread.org  All Rights Reserved. \n Substituting xanthan for these is simple as you use a 1:1 ratio. Just use the same \namount of chia (in weight) as you would xanthan and you\u2019re all set!  \nPsyllium Husk  \nPsyllium husk or psyllium fibre is a relatively new binding agent which is typically used \nas a xanthan substitute in breads. It has been scientifically proven to improve the  \nstructure of Gluten Free dough and improve the texture, volume and rising of gluten free \nbaked bread. \nIt is typically found as a dietary fibre supplement in most health stores and is used b y \nathletes to lower cholesterol. A 5% psyllium fibre flour mix is best for baking breads (1 \npart psyllium to 19 parts of flour). \nKonjac Powder  \nAlso known as Glucomannan powder, Konjac powder is ground up konjac root which \nhas been used in Asia as a dietary fiber for several hundreds of years. Like Psyllium \nfiber, it is used as a supplementary source of fiber as well as a thickener. \nIts high fiber content lends it numerous health benefits which include the reduction of \nblood cholesterol and a lower bowel cancer risk. It also helps control blood sugar levels \nbut its binding properties are most relevant for our purposes. \nWhen used in baking, you can use the same amount of Konjac powder as you w ould \nxanthan gum (1/2 teaspoon per cup of flour for cakes and breads). For other bake d \ngoods like flatbreads or tortillas, you can increase the amount of Konjac you use to \u00be \nteaspoon per cup of four to get the desired consistency. \nFlax Seeds  \nFlaxseeds are extremely popular in baking and also as a health supplement (flaxseed \noil). They are a great binding agent and are easily found (because of their popularity ). \nOn top of all this, they are cheap to buy! \n \nIn their natural form, flaxseeds are not very useful as a binding agent. They  have to be \nground first and then mixed with hot water . The water has to be boiled first and then \nmixed with the flax to form a gel like paste known as \u2018slurry\u2019 which is then added to \ngluten free flour for baking breads and cakes. \nFor substitution, use the same weight of ground flax as you would xanthan gum. Then \nmix it in twice the amount of water (2 tbsp. of ground flax mixed with 4 tbsp. o f hot \nboiling water). \nAgar Agar  \nAgar Agar is a seaweed derivative which acts as a stabilizer, thickener and binding \nagent.

Baking can be one of life's great \npleasures, and if you are cutting refined sugar in your diet then sugar substitutes and sugar alternatives \noffer a lighter way to enjoy sweet treats. Here's what you need to know before using them.  \nFirstly, they can be expensive and if you don't know the best way to incorporate them in bakes you may \nspoil your hard work. BBC Good Food\u2019s nutritionist Kerry Torrens pointed out that: \"Using refined sugar in \nbakin g isn't all about sweetness \u2013 it\u2019s responsible for that delicious texture and crumb, that lovely golden -\nbrown colour and it helps extend the storage time of your bake. That's if your cake hangs around long \nenough! Sugar also keeps bakes moist, so sugar -free versions may need to be wrapped before storage \nto prevent them drying out.\"  \nWhat are the top tips for sugar -free baking?  \n1. Whole fruit  \nNature\u2019s natural sweet treat, whether fresh, frozen, dried or pur\u00e9ed, fruit adds flavour, moisture and \nnutrients to  your bakes and is amazingly versatile.  \nBananas are an obvious choice but don't forget other exotic fruits, like pineapple and mango. One of the \nkey considerations when using fruit is to make sure it is as ripe as possible so you optimise its natural \nsweet ness. Be prepared for some trial and error before you get your favourite recipe to work. Replacing \nrefined sugar with, say, an apple pur\u00e9e, is clearly not a straightforward swap, so you\u2019ll need to play \naround with the amount of fluid and the dry ingredient s before you get the combination right.  \nDried fruit like dates, sultanas, prunes and apricots are concentrated sources of sweetness, rich in fibre \nas well as nutrients including iron and potassium. They make a great choice for boosting the sweetness \nof a r ecipe and when used as a pur\u00e9e they add extra moisture and stickiness. Where possible use whole \nfruit, with its skin intact \u2013 that way you'll be benefiting from the addition of fibre and extra nutrients.  \n \n \nGluten -free lemon drizzle cake  \n \nGive it a go with our  sugar -free banana bread , baked banana cheesecake  and cinnamon apple \npecan pudding . \n2. Fruit pur\u00e9es and syrups  \nOptimise the natural sweetness of fruit, like dates, by making a pur\u00e9e  or syrup and use instead of treacle, \ngolden syrup, maple syrup, agave syrup, rice syrup or honey, all of these are classed as  'free' sugars  \u2013 \nthe type we are advised to cut back on.  \nSyrups add a gooey texture to traybakes, cookies and tarts, which is hard to mimic. However, fruit pur\u00e9es \nsupply sweetness and moisture and make a useful alternative.

Vegetables  \nPopular veggie choices include carrots, parsnips and beetroot \u2013 these all w ork surprisingly well in sweet \ntreats, as do sweet potatoes, squash and even courgettes. A great tip is to combine vegetables, like \nthese, with an ingredient such as ground almonds so you can mimic that crumbly, naturally sweet, cakey \ncrumb.  \nYou can also c ombine veggies with fruit and other sugar substitutes as we\u2019ve done in our  sugar -free \ncarrot cake  and squidgy chocolate sandwich cake . \n4. Xylitol  \nIf you're looking for a low -calorie, low -GI substitute that will give you a straight swap for sugar, xylitol may \nbe the answer. Despite its s ynthetic -sounding name,  xylitol  is extracted from hardwood trees and the \nfibres of some fruit and vegetables. It looks and tastes like sugar \u2013 although some people experience a \nslight after -taste. With fewer calories than refined sugar and a low glycaemic index (GI) it has less of an \nimpact on blood sugar levels, which means you can enjoy that sweet taste without the resulting 'rush' that \nregular s ugar might give you. For this reason, xylitol may be a useful alternative for people \nwith diabetes  and because it has a reduced calorific value it may also help those looking to lose weight.  \nThere\u2019s another important benefit with xylitol and that is it doesn't cause dental decay. You can use it as a \nsubstitute in many r ecipes on a one -to-one basis, but not those which use yeast as a raising agent. You \nshould also be aware that cakes sweetened with xylitol don't tend to colour very much, but that\u2019s not a \nproblem for coffee or chocolate cakes. One word of warning: xylitol can have a laxative effect so go easy \nwhen you first try it \u2013 a slice of cake shouldn't be an issue though. Be warned, if you have a dog in the \nfamily, keep it well away from products made with xylitol \u2013 it's highly toxic to our canine friends.  \nGive these diabetic -friendly cakes, made using xylitol, a go:  sugar -free lemon drizzle \ncake , Moroccan orange & cardamom cake  and sugar -free victoria sponge cake . \n \n5. Erythritol  \nPopular among those following a  keto diet , erythritol is seen as the next -generation sweetener following \nxylitol and it shares many of xylitol\u2019s properties, including be ing kind to the teeth. Found naturally in fruit, \nthis processed powder is a low -calorie sweetener and tastes like sugar but because it's metabolised \ndifferently by the body it doesn\u2019t spike  blood sugar levels  in the same way.  \nErythritol works well in bakes but because it is not as sweet as sugar you do need to use a little more \u2013 \nroughly 30% more. It doesn\u2019t caramelise and it doesn\u2019t dissolve as well as su gar, so if you\u2019re looking for a \nmoist, gooey sweet bake you may need to add another sweetener to the mix.  \nAlthough  less likely to cause dige stive issues  than xylitol, if you eat too much of it you may experience \nbloating, wind and diarrhoea.  \nTry keto -friendly baking with our  keto chocolate cake  and keto brownies . \n6. Stevia  \nIf you're cutting down on calories and want to make a sugar -free cake, try stevia. Made from the leaves of \na plant that contains sweet -tasting compounds called steviol glycosides, stevia is up to 300 times sweeter ", "doc_id": "ca552aae-82c9-4911-90a5-ec29043e4ded", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cbc9f443a98710327eed1e987c1303e020a2cc8630265e442e9181a386f8d75b", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Sugar_free_tip.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3237, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4a279a14-b85f-49cf-aad8-12e3f71c80d6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "90c6d3bc-e8d5-4b9d-a097-8cd2eec1e038": {"__data__": {"text": "than sugar, so the amount you use is tiny in comparison. What's more, it  doesn't impact blood sugar \nlevels  or cause tooth decay.  \nStevia is available as granules, tablets or in liquid form and is stable at high temperatures, so it can be \nused in bakes and puddings. You will need to use a specially adapted recipe, though, because swapping \nthe quantity of sugar for stevia is not a stra ight swap. This is because stevia doesn\u2019t caramelise or work \nwell in recipes where sugar is key to the structure and texture of the bake.  \nAs well as being calorie -free, stevia contributes nothing in the way of nutrition, so it's what we call a non -\nnutritiv e sweetener \u2013 it supplies that sweet taste and that's all.  \nGive stevia a go in our fabulous  keto pancakes . \n7. Agave syrup  \nSyrups like  agave  are popular ingredients for a gooey flapjack or a sticky ginger cake \u2013 but whether you \nopt for golden syrup, maple syrup, honey, agave or  rice syrup they're all classed as 'free' sugars \u2013 the \ntype we should be cutting back on. If you're using these alternatives then strictly speaking your bake is \nnot sugar -free, but you may, depending on which you use, be benefiting from some nutritional \nadvantages like trace vitamins and minerals. However, because the amount is so small it's unlikely to \nhave any impact on your health.  \nEnjoy the sweetness of agave in our  healthier flapjacks  and lower sugar cookies . \n \n8. Coconut sugar  \nCoconut sugar is made from the sap of the flower buds of th e coconut palm tree, it\u2019s less processed than \nrefined sugar and as a result retains some trace nutrients, although the amounts are negligible.  \nFlavour -wise, coconut sugar has the taste of caramel and works well in recipes that would typically use \nbrown sug ar. It can be used like for like to replace sugar but don\u2019t be under any illusions, coconut sugar is \nstill just that \u2013 another form of sugar and a costly one. It is available as a syrup or in crystallised form.  \n9. Palm sugar  \nPalm sugar as its name suggests  is made from palm sap, like coconut sugar it has caramel flavours and \nis available both as a syrup and in crystallised form. Popular in Asian cuisine, palm sugar may also be \nused in cakes and bakes. That said, don\u2019t forget this is a minimally processed fo rm of sugar so will \ninfluence blood sugar levels in much the same way.  \n10. Jaggery  \nThis is an unrefined version of sugar and as such is made from sugar cane or date palm. It is available as \na block, liquid or as granules and can be used as a direct replace ment.  \nJaggery has gained a bit of a health \u2018halo\u2019 because being minimally processed it retains some  trace \nnutrients , but these amounts are negligible and don\u2019t be fooled, this is still sugar.  \n ", "doc_id": "90c6d3bc-e8d5-4b9d-a097-8cd2eec1e038", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5b78252b3f1e66d25ffd92d806be1331dfcb916b150bc0565e82a2a12b603d21", "extra_info": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Sugar_free_tip.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2751, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "91a3d4b4-1c1a-41a4-8bb6-fb282de20690"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bacd5e3b-df62-43dd-a393-b4872a7dfdf8": {"__data__": {"text": "11. Chocolate  \nIf you love the flavour of chocolate why not make a savvy swap? It\u2019s worth remembering that even dark \n70%-cocoa chocolate may contain sugar, as can cocoa powder. We love to use raw cacao nibs and raw \ncacao powder instead of chocolate in many of our recipes. Raw cacao has a rich flavour, so you may only \nneed a small amount and it is a source of minerals including iron and magnesium. It wo rks well in cakes, \ncupcakes, tortes and cookies.  \nCheck out this speedy  keto mug cake  with peanut butter.  \n12. Flour  \nSwapping refined white flour for wholemea l may not seem like an obvious sugar swap but refined white \nflour is digested quickly \u2013 this means it's converted into glucose that will aggravate blood sugar levels. \nUsing wholemeal flour instead slows the rate at which your body absorbs all forms of suga r. \nWe used wholemeal flour to make our  vegan strawberry pancakes . \n13. Vanilla  \nIn the grand scheme of things vanilla extract isn't too bad, but if you're keen to avoid processed products \nopt for vanilla pods instead. Although they are a little more pricey than extract, it's easy to make each pod \ngo a little further. Once you've remov ed and used the seeds, keep the pods and use them to infuse milk, \nyogurt and cream, as well as stewed fruits and pur\u00e9es.  \n14.

Naturally flavour your homemade compote with spices such as cinnamon, \nvanilla or ginger, or make a fruit pur\u00e9e using mango , pineapple or apricots.  \n \n15. Toppings  \nUse lighter toppings in place of icing, buttercream and frosting \u2013 these little extras can more than double \nthe calories per portion. Instead, sprinkle your cake lightly with cacao powder, cinnamon or ground \nginger. Use a cream cheese topping flav oured with citrus zest, or a fresh cream filling with some seasonal \nfruit. \n \n ", "doc_id": "bacd5e3b-df62-43dd-a393-b4872a7dfdf8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a2f4cdab02ad5ee067040299bc452605728214680b74b3af3b5b40e7c5a3c9e6", "extra_info": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Sugar_free_tip.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1950, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "518fbcab-8d5e-4b72-80c8-29656fa11ca1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "48da7744-c18f-42ca-b4aa-9a50c1cda944": {"__data__": {"text": "20 Bakery Chiang Mai The sweet line is not to be missed!

The role of oxidants in bread making  systems is that of \nimproving the gas retention abilities of the dough thro ugh better gluten \ndevelopment. With the addition of suitable oxidizing  materials to the dough we \ncan reduce the development time for doughs fro m many hours to less than 10 \nminutes and achieve most of the changes in the mixer.  If we use a high speed \nmixer we can achieve full dough  development in less than  5 minutes.

Slow acting \nones such as potassium  bromate have been used widely  and were com mon \nthroughout Europe. The faster acting ones such as potassium iodate, calcium \niodate, and azodicarbonamide are more wi dely used in USA.  However with a \ngreater awareness of food additives by the general population, and a greater \nunderstanding of their fu nction, a number of changes to legislation on Europe \nhave been made with the result that we are left with ascorbic acid ( or Vitamin \nC or E 300) as the sole oxidizing  agent for use in the baking industry.  At present \nthe level of use is quantum sat is =use as much as required. These  oxidizing  \nagents are commonly added as part of the bread improver, but they can also be \nadded to flours by the miller. Bakers need to be aware that they do not over -\ndose bread dough by adding oxidizing  agents from several sources . \nReducing agents . Reducing agen ts make dough more extensible. They  are \ndeliberately added to 'weaken' structure in specific products.  The major \nmaterial used in bread dough is an amino acid known as L -cysteine.  It can only \nbe used at low levels in improvers but by reducing dough resis tance to \ndeformation it helps in molding  and shape forming, such as rolls and baps, \nwithout structural damage.  L-cysteine can also be used in pan breads at  low \nlevels where its ability to reduce resistance can help reduce streaking  caused \nby molding  faults . Other ingredients such as deactivated yeast and proteases \nhave a similar effect.

Enzymes in bread  \nCereal \u03b1 -amylase is naturally present in flour. It breaks the starch into simple \nsugars to feed the young plant. Levels will vary depending on the quality of the \nwheat and the weather conditions during harvest. Cereal \u03b1 -amylase  can be a \nbeneficial bread improver, but at high levels can cause stickiness, mos t \nnoticeably in sandwich breads; the levels are m easured in seconds using \nHagberg Falling Number (HFN), where 60s is a very high level and 450s is a very \nlow level. Flour mill ers control the level in flour by blending the wheats. The \nterm alpha -amylase is used to describe a range of enzymes, which are capable \nof breaking down damaged starch granules into materials known as dextrins \nand in combination with beta -amylase they will  produce maltose.  Alpha and \nbeta -amylase work in combination. Beta -amylase attacks the ends of the \namylose and amylopectin chains breaking off individual maltose sugar \nmolecules. Most wheat flours contain adequate levels of beta -amylase so it is \nthe alpha -amylase that controls the reaction. Additions of alpha -amylase to \ndoughs via improvers and even in flour mills are preferred in the fungal rather \nthat the cereal form.  This is because the fungal form is inactivated at lower \ntemperatures in the baking proc ess and reduces the risk of the formation of \nhigh levels of sticky dextrins.  Excess cereal \u03b1 - amylase  reduces bread quality. \nCereal alpha -amylase is produced during the growing cycle and can achieve \nquite high levels if the period around harvesting is wet.   The dextrins which are \nproduced by the action of alpha -amylase on damaged starch are sticky and if \ntheir level is high enough in the finished bread they build up on the slicer \nblades and can reduce their efficiency to such an extent that loaves will \ncollapse.  \nThe other widely used enzyme is hemicellulase, also known as pentosanase and \nxylanase. This was added to the list of permitted enzymes in 1996 and has \nalready achieved widespread use.
