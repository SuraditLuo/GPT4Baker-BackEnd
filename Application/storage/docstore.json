Keep it simple  \nThe mistake many small businesses make is that they try to  find a CRM application that \ndoes too much. Take the time to find out what your internal needs really are and who \nwill use the CRM daily. Once you have that, then you are better placed to improve your \nclient relationships and build loyalty.  \n2. Stay in touc h \nMake customer communications timely and relevant.   Don\u2019t spam existing customers, \nbut also be careful not to contact them too infrequently. Targeting tailored messages at \ncustomers according to what they are interested in, via their preferred medium, is the \nbest way to build relationship.  \n3. Build a partnership  \nTake an active interest in your customer\u2019s business and move from doing what\u2019s \nexpected of you, to getting more involved in your customer\u2019s world.   Where you aspire to \nbuilding a long -term relation ship with a specific customer, make efforts to understand \ntheir business objectives and company ethos so you can become more than just a \nsupplier.  \n4.

Be sure to ask your customers what is \nimportant to them and find out why your customers do business with you so you can \nensure you are meeting their needs.  \n6.

When I first started baking whole grain breads over twenty yearsago, baking bread was my hobby.This hobby evolved into an avid inter-est and love for using a wide variety of God\u2019s amazing grains.  Eventuallyit became my entry point into a pursuit of sound nutritional principles,taking responsibility for my family\u2019s health and mastering other home-making skills such as gardening, canning and dehydrating.  Whatever your motives for learning, I believe that baking your ownbread fulfills a deep, natural inborn desire within every man and womanto return to a simpler, slower life where the fundamental act of breakinghomemade bread with family and others is the beginning of fulfillingthese deep longings within, and a natural way to establish relationshipswith mankind from any culture around the world. Those with busy schedules might enjoy baking for the fun of it.  Thiswill give you the opportunity to enjoy blessing your family, and it is alsoa great activity to share with children who love to eat what they make.Sometimes, husbands and children will be a bit, shall I say, resistantto new foods, especially if they are considered healthier!  One lady wroteto me saying: For years my husband thought the idea of buying a flour  millwas \u2018out there\u2019and he didn't okay my purchasing it - I can't tellyou how  gratifying it is that he became a convert so quickly.We have all felt much more energetic since making the switchto home-milled, home-baked bread.Susan Davis, MNBaking bread need not be complicated, either.  My basic whole wheatbread recipe has very few ingredients, and once the recipe is masteredthere are dozens of easy bread variations.  Here is what another clientwrote: I've been reading some other websites and recipes but they allsound difficult and scary.  I'm not much of a baker or cook, soI'm sticking with Marilyn\u2019s Famous Whole Wheat Bread Recipefor good!  I've found it is the easiest and tastiest bread recipe wehave ever tried.  There is no need to look any further.Thanks. This book is my attempt to put together a basic beginner\u2019s bread bak-ing guide.  It includes background information regarding ingredients,supplies and equipment, along with basic and reliable recipes to get youstarted.  Many of you, as I am, are busy people who do not have all dayto nurture their baking efforts.  As such, you will find my instructionsand techniques are designed to fit in with today\u2019s busy lifestyles.  My recipes for yeast breads depend on basic ingredients, freshlymilled flour (if possible), basic skills, and a willingness to learn.  Armedwith modern equipment and a little know-how, you can set aside a week-ly time slot for family baking, and you will learn to incorporate this prac-tice into your routine with minimal disruption. \n89\n", "doc_id": "baa4930e-5a85-4cc5-bc6f-04a029a66113", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "157d5591b7d56ab9de3113cb0bf41dbcd6b1f47da2d906c9c178a7c699b42076", "extra_info": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "12.

Let me introduce youto a few of the benefits of baking with basic ingredients.  The satisfac-tion of making something that is economical, nutritious, and taps into ourcreative side is truly heart warming and encouraging to us as moms.I had been baking our family\u2019s whole grain baked goods for a fewyears when my oldest daughter, at the time about 5 years old, asked myhusband, Duane, who was filling in for a friend\u2019s newspaper route, if shecould help on the route.  He told Laura that he would take her out tobreakfast if she wanted to get up early (4 AM!) and accompany him onthe route.  After the route was completed that morning, Laura orderedpancakes at the restaurant.  After taking a couple bites, she said, \u201cDaddy,this tastes funny.  I can\u2019t eat it.\u201d  White flour pancakes were no longerappetizing to her; she wanted the real thing - mom\u2019s whole grain pan-cakes!There are two ways to react to this restaurant vignette; disappoint-ment at the wasted breakfast, or pleasure, fulfillment and contentmentthat your efforts to provide nourishing foods resulted in a young daugh-ter who naturally preferred the superior whole grain taste.  If you\u2019ve triedto bake your own bread before and met with less than desirable results,or  if you have a family that was not receptive to the new tastes, takeheart!  It can be accomplished gradually with patience and determina-tion.SuperiorNutritionDid you know that whole grain wheat has 26 naturally occurringvitamins and minerals, along with quality fiber, wheat germ, and oil?Unfortunately the refining process removes these powerful nutritionalingredients.  White refined flour has four B-vitamins added back inwhich are not even in the original proportions.  That's it!  Consumingwhite flour products is like being robbed of necessary vitamins and min-erals. Your body needs nutrient dense foods for good health.  The term\u201cnutrient dense\u201d refers to foods that naturally contain a high spectrum of1011", "doc_id": "df8d97b9-8025-4a5a-8def-2697a11fa9a5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "edb92386935e1c84ecc3e6a7781851062495f429c063d508c6ffc0c87d920745", "extra_info": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "12.

Other than calories, refined flour baked goodscontain little nutritional value.  Many of us have grown accustomed tospending our family\u2019s precious grocery dollars on items that do not satis-fy the body nutritionally, or that are largely manufactured and processedfoods made of inferior ingredients at significant costbecause that is the way we were raised..Anumber of common degenerative diseases, such ashemorrhoids, constipation, arthritis, cancer,diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and allergiesare associated with low fiber diets along withthe consumption of refined and processedfoods.  I, too, have been guilty of buying junkfoods as a treat and convenience foods at awhim, or because my children would beg fornutritionally deficient cheesey curls or chips.  My heart\u2019s desire is to spend preciousgrocery dollars on nutritionally superior foods and learn to make them adelicious alternative.  And it\u2019s not that hard.  My husband, who grew uploving white bread with peanut butter and jelly, now thinks it\u2019s disgust-ing.  It\u2019s a matter of what you become accustomed to eating.  Taste budsthat have been accustomed to tasteless foods gradually accommodate thechange to more flavorful whole foods.Taking responsibility for your family\u2019s health by cooking most ofyour meals from basic whole food ingredients seems like a huge under-taking to modern homemakers who have been raised on the convenienceof over-processed commercial breads, cereals, crackers, muffins, rolls,etc.  Our goal is to take this nutritional adventure one step at a timealways remembering that gradual change is permanent change;quick changes generally are neither lasting nor effective.EconomyRecently, I calculated the cost of making Marilyn\u2019s Famous WholeWheat Bread.  My cost came in at under one dollar, at the time of thiswriting, for a 1  1/2 pound loaf of whole grain goodness.  Depending onthe cost of your ingredients you will be able to make superior tastingbread for a similar cost because you will be eliminating the cost of  theplastic disposable packaging, the bakery\u2019s overhead for producing thebread, the transportation costs to ship the bread from the bakery to thestore, the bakery manager's salary, and other costs of purchasing ready-made breads.Depending on the size of your family and how many loaves of breadyours consumes each week, you can calculate the annual savings.   Forexample, in my family, we consume four loaves of sandwich bread aweek.  Commercial equivalent bread costs $4.25 in my area, and beloware the savings you can realize by making your own bread: If I make cinnamon rolls, dinner rolls, homemade pancakes, waffles,biscuits etc., Ican increase the savings.  Several years back, a customer told me that she quit baking herhomemade bread for a while, and that is when her son had an appendici-tis attack.  She believes it was related to returning to a white bread diet.The emergency surgery and hospital bills were covered by insurance, buttheir portion of the bill would have more than paid for a brand new milland mixer.The point I\u2019m making is that when we take responsibility for ourfamily\u2019s health, medical bills can diminish dramatically.Another cus-tomer contacted me recently and reported thatmaking nutritional changes in her family\u2019s dietduring a one year time period had cut theirmedical expenses in half that year compared tothe previous year.This resulted in savings ofover $1,000 for her family in medical andpharmacy bills.  Our family has not needed tosee a doctor for other than emergencies (a bro-ken arm, a bike accident) or sports and campphysicals for many years.SatisfactionAmother who is busy at home cooking and baking from", "doc_id": "d9fe4158-14a2-4aaf-a53c-83b69d9dda75", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "eb909000462a1c0c2f7eb2c5a1b219b0ce8308d39551c64b434ef9f05701be97", "extra_info": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "12.

Wheat is the number one cereal grain produced worldwide andused widely in the United States.  When Cyrus McCormick invented amechanical reaper around 1831, it made a much higher production ofgrain possible than could be accomplished previously with hand scythesor sickles.  As a result, grains, including wheat, became a much moreversatile commodity.Wheat  breads are unique from most other cereal grains used in breadmaking because wheat contains a much higher percentage of a proteincalled gluten.  The benefit of gluten is that it becomes stretchy afterkneading, which enables the bread dough to hold it\u2019s shape during andafter rising.Think of stretchy gluten like a blowing up a balloon.  As the yeastferments or \u201cconsumes\u201d the starch in the flour, carbon dioxide is createdand becomes trapped in the gluten strands or \u201cballoons\u201d of the breaddough.  Gradually, the carbon dioxide raises the bread similar to blowingup a balloon.  Historically, societies have preferred yeast leavened breadswhen they are available.In America today, 42 of the50 states produce some form ofwheat.  The types of wheat pro-duced vary by climate andgrowing conditions.  Hard wheats are grown inthe northern half of the US.The cold temperatures and dryconditions contribute to theenhanced protein content.  Hard red winter, hard red spring, durum, andhard white wheats are primarily produced west of the Mississippi.Soft wheats are grown predominately east of the Mississippi River.In general, soft wheats are used for baked goods that do notcontainyeast, and hard wheats are used for yeast breads.

The wheat kernel, sometimes called the wheat berry, is the seed fromwhich the wheat plant grows. Each tiny seed contains three distinct partsthat are separated during the milling process to produce flour.The kernelof wheat is a storehouse of nutrients essential to the human diet.BranThe bran contains 14 1/2 percent of the kernel weight.  Bran is includ-ed in whole wheat flour and is also available separately.  Of the nutrientsin whole wheat, the bran contains a small amount of protein, larger quan-tities of the B-complex vita-mins, trace minerals, and indi-gestible cellulose material alsocalled dietary fiber.GermThe germ contains abouttwo and a half percent of thekernel weight.  The germ is theembryo or sprouting section ofthe seed, usually separatedbecause of the fat that limits thekeeping quality of flour.  Of thenutrients in whole wheat, thegerm contains minimal quanti-ties of protein, but a greatershare of B-complex vitamins,Vitamin E, and trace minerals.Wheat germ can be purchasedseparately.EndospermThe endosperm contains 83percent of the kernel weight. Itis the source of white flour.Theendosperm contains the greatestshare of the protein in the wholekernel, carbohydrates, and ironas well as many B-complexvitamins, such as riboflavin,niacin, and thiamine.Refined flour loses between 48-98% of the many naturally occurringvitamins and minerals.  There are estimated to be 26 vitamins and min-erals in a kernel of wheat.  Only Vitamins B-1, B-2, and B-3 and folicacid and iron are added to white flour in a synthetic form, which classi-fies it as \u201cenriched flour\u201d. 1617\n", "doc_id": "9ca9d9d7-24d6-40e5-a9f7-a28ced19954c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e53a1e9b89a1773654a10818418e294e98e9d9ea17b81c4729c17306c1fd9a26", "extra_info": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "12.

Pastry flour is used for baked goods that contain bakingpowder and can be substituted, cup for cup, for all-purpose flour inany recipe.Whole Wheat Flour- Commercially ground whole wheat flour iscoarse-textured and should be stored in the freezer to protect againstrancidity.Whole wheat flour is rich in B-complex vitamins, vitaminE, protein, and contains significantly more trace minerals and dietaryfiber than white flour, however oxidation of the flour  (the combiningof oxygen with nutrients in the flour) results in a tremendous loss ofnutritional content within just a few days.  Fresh milled whole wheatflour is therefore best nutritionally.Hard WinterWheat- Planted in the fall; usually dry-land wheat grownwithout irrigation.  Often grown for animal feed.  Tends to be lowerin protein than hard spring wheat, resulting in lowered performance.Both hard red and hard white winter wheats can be used for yeastbreads.Hard Spring Wheat- Planted in the spring.  Both hard red and hardwhite wheats are grown this way.  It is not irrigated, thus yielding ahigh protein and low moisture content wheat kernel.  This wheattends to be more expensive because of the higher quality protein con-tent and because it is known to make the lightest whole wheat bread.We have found that Montana grown wheat is generally the best qual-ity.  Many husbands and children prefer the milder flavor and lightercolor of hard white wheat made into yeast bread.  Hard white springwheat makes up about 95% of our grain sales.Soft Spring Wheat- Usually this wheat is irrigated.  It has a larger yieldthan hard wheat but is lower in protein.  It is used for making cakescookies, muffins, pancakes, pie crusts, pastries and baked goods thatuse baking powder.When home milling soft wheat, be sure to packfreshly milled pastry flour into a measuring cup, just like whenmeasuring brown sugar, to get accurate measurements.Durum Wheat- Used for making pasta.  Semolina is a refined grade ofmilled Durum wheat used in homemade pasta.Obtaining Whole Grain in BulkBuy grains in bulk, in a 25- or 50-pound bag for the best pricingand convenience.  Store  grain in food grade plastic pails for best econ-omy.The pails are like having the convenience of a grocery storeright in your home.

These lids make access to your grain quite convenient. GammaSeal lids and plastic food grade pails/buckets may also be used over andover for grain storage. Whole grain flours should be used freshly milled.  If you need tostore flour it should be stored in a freezer and used within approximate-ly 3 weeks.

Brown rice should not be stored long-term asit will tend to go rancid after a few months.  Remember the rule ofthumb for food storage: Store what you eat, eat what you store.  Rotate,rotate, rotate!

Basic Ingredients forYeast BreadOnly four ingredients are really essential to making yeast breads:yeast, salt, flour, and water.All other ingredients are optional but mostbakers include additional ingredients in their basic bread recipes such aseggs, oil, honey or sugar for taste, texture, variety,  nutrition, and flavor.Below, I have described the function and purpose of common  ingre-dients found in yeast bread recipes.High quality flourTo get started, purchase or mill the best quality whole wheat flouryou can.  Don\u2019t wait until you get a grain mill.  There is lots to learnabout yeast bread making, so get started now.LiquidsWater, preferably filtered, is the most commonly used liquid in yeastbread, followed by milk.  Fruit juice or combinations of water and milkare also called for in many bread recipes.  Filtered water removes chlo-rine and other contaminants found in tap water.  Filtered water is not onlyhealthier, it also removes contaminants that can interfere with yeastactivity.  Milk adds richness, nutritional value, and flavor to the bread.YeastAlthough there are many brands of yeast available, Ihave found SAF or Fermipan Instant Yeast to be the mostreliable, heat tolerant, concentrated, and economical yeastavailable for bread making.  In fact, both SAF and Fermipanare used by commercial bread makers and institutions. Instant yeast  can be added  directly to the dough mixture withoutproofing, saving time and extra steps.   It is also known as Rapid Rise.Active Dry Yeast is another type of yeast that is widely available andeconomical, but generally has a shorter shelf life and fewer live", "doc_id": "3dbd391a-7ed9-4597-a989-5b43c22972f0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9d7538f31978de81cfc6c3bbafa01ce2bc9e0f3d7a03e29d860b4dfb3d476da2", "extra_info": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "12.

It controls yeastactivity so the bread doesn't rise too quickly and eliminates the \"flat\" tastethat will result if you forget this ingredient.  If you forget to add salt, youwill immediately notice the flat taste of the bread and know instinctivelythat something is missing.  The only bread I have ever thrown awaylacked salt!  Not all salt is the same.  Real Salt\u2122 and some sea salts do not con-tain additives, nor have they been heat processed to excessive tempera-tures.  Check the labels on salt containers for additives, including alu-minum compounds used for anti-caking and avoid such salts.FatsOil or butter produce a more tender crumb or texture in the bread,which also promotes shelf life.  French breads have little or no oil andusually go stale within a day.  Use the highest quality oil or butter you canafford. Expeller pressed oils which require refrigeration have not beenheat processed to high temperatures to make the oil shelf stable.  Expellerpressed oils, extra virgin olive oil (does not require refrigeration), coconutoil, safflower oil, or butter are considered the  healthiest choices.  SweetenersHoney and sugar are the sweeteners that are mostfrequently called for in yeast breads.   Sweetenerspromote yeast activity  by feeding the yeast aswell as enhancing the flavor.  Honey can be sub-stituted, cup for cup, for sugar and I have foundbread made with honey will not stale as quickly.All my yeast bread recipes call for honey.Dough EnhancerThis ingredient does not have a strict definition.  Somedough enhancers are mostly vital gluten while others containingredients (usually natural such as whey,Vitamin C, andlecithin) that increase dough strength, lightness, and shelflife.  This is an optional ingredient that many home bakers have found toimprove the quality of their breads.EggsPrimarily are added to improve the texture and flavor of the bread.Vital GlutenThis optional ingredient really makes a difference inhelping a family transition from refined flour bread to wholegrain bread because it boosts the protein content of the bread(gluten) and strengthens the bread dough, giving the doughthe ability to rise nicely.The resulting bread will be muchsofter, not crumbly, and will rise nicely so the whole grain bread won\u2019tbe heavy or dense.  Unless you are one who prefers heavy dense breads, your husbandand children will appreciate your first whole grain baking experiencesmore if you add vital gluten.  Depending on the quality and protein con-tent of the flour and personal preferences, you may want to use vitalgluten in a recipe. Premium wheats may not need vital gluten.  Agood place to start isto add one half tablespoon vital gluten per cup of flour.Adjust thisamount up or down based on your preference.  Whole grain breads pre-pared in a bread machine require 3-4 table-spoons of vital gluten per loaf, regardless ofthe quality of the wheat.  Nuts, seeds, orgrains otherthan wheatSunflower seeds, flax seeds, and crackedgrains are the most common ingredientsadded to yeast  breads to add nutty andcrunchy appeal, as well as nutritional value.Other grains such as millet, cracked seven grain blend, corn, or oatmealcan be added up to one fourth of the total amount of flour called for in abasic recipe.  Since most of these additions do not contain gluten, thebread will rise more slowly and possibly result in a slightly heavier,chewier product. Compensate by adding a little extra vital gluten.  It isbest to soak the grains or seeds before adding it to the yeast dough.2223\n", "doc_id": "1e931441-29d3-4141-91c2-4778dc14f63c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "24bb76e543afb1d57eadf43c8e6967578641ac18e8d0133bdbd27a81d61e7497", "extra_info": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "12.

Fresh flours taste better and perform much better in whole grainrecipes.2. Fresh flour contains all the vitamins and minerals missing in commer-cial white flours.  It includes the bran which is vital for a healthycolon and weight control.  Fresh flours are also more nutritious thanstore-bought whole grain flours because oxidation of the flours caus-es a great percentage of nutritional loss soon after milling3. Fresh flour is economical!  It only costs about 50\u00a2 to $1.00 per poundwhen freshly milled.4. If you mill only the amount of flour needed, essential nutrients are pre-served.  Within 24 hours up to 40% of the nutrients have oxidized.  Inthree days up to 80% of the nutrients have oxidized.5. Stale flours become rancid because the germ oils in the grain combinewith oxygen in the air when the seed coat is broken.   Rancid oils andflours strain the immune system, speed the aging process and con-tribute free radicals into our bodies.  I have had many people tell methat their bread tastes better after milling it fresh.6. When you mill your flour fresh you may enjoy various grains such asrye, corn, oats, rice, amaranth, spelt, quinoa, and Kamut\u2122, as well asbeans.  Different varieties of flours are good for rotation diets, econ-omy, and for variations in taste.4Selecting AGrain Mill and MixerWhen I purchased my first grain mill, I was the stay-at-home momof a 22-month-old daughter and money was extremely tight.  In fact,before my husband gave his OK for this purchase, he asked me,  \u201cIf I buyyou this grain mill, will you commit to making all of our family\u2019sbread?\u201d Yes, that question threw me for a loopand I had to carefully count the costs and seeif I was that committed or if this was just apassing fancy.  Eventually I said, \u201cYes, I willcommit to baking all our bread.\u201dThat was overtwenty years ago and I have never looked back.Once whole grain is milled into flour, it beginsgoing rancid and loses a significant portion of thenutritional value and baking properties within seven-ty-two hours of milling.  Freshly milled flour should beused within a few hours or frozen for future use. When frozen,it should be used within three weeks.  An added benefit to using freshlymilled flour is the flour temperature is ideal for yeast activity. Bringfrozen flour to room temperature before starting bread making.Maybe you are wondering if you are really willing to commit to bak-ing for your family.  Possibly you have already enjoyed the benefits offreshly milled flour, courtesy of a friend or relative, and you are ready toinvest.  Regardless, you already know that you will be much more satis-fied with your baking results when you are able to use high quality homemilled flour.Electric vs Non-Electric Grain MillsThere are many good electric and non-electric grain mills on themarket in various price ranges.  The advantage of non-electric mills isthat they are quiet to run, usually require a lower initial investment andoffer the ability to adjust the fineness of the flour from fine to coarselycracked.

Usually it takes about fiveminutes of hand cranking to produce one cup of flour, making hand grainmills the ideal choice for emergencies when electricity fails, but they areusually not practical for everyday family use, especially if you are bakingfor a large family.In my 20 years of experience with grain mills, I have found there isno \"perfect\" or \"best\" grain mill that meets all the criteria of every cus-tomer.The \"best\" grain mill, is the mill that meets your personal criteriafor price, noise level, storage space requirements, warranty, and versatil-ity.  Many of the more popular grain mills are used for grains and drybeans and typically should not be used for oily seeds, nuts, or coffee.Following is an outline of the three major categories of grain mills -electric, stone, and micronizer - with a few of theadvantages and disadvantages of each.   Check the manufacturers recom-mendations for what it is designed tomill.Stone MillsStone Mills can be both electric ornon-electric and are capable ofmilling fine flours and will also adjustto produce coarse flour and  crackedgrains.   In general, stone mills are good for milling most grains, butnot dry beans.  The stones need periodic cleaning and ultimately weardown.  Certain grains, like corn, have a tendency to glaze the stoneswhich means the milling stones will need to be cleaned.  Whereas stones were at one time typically mined and cut for millingpurposes, most stones today are produced in factories which use  alu-minum as a binder to hold the stone particles together.  Consider thatstone mills  generally  are heavier in weight and usually take up muchstorage space.  In addition, stone mills tend to be more expensive thanmodern mills that use a newer technology and, depending on thespeed of operation, may heat the flour to higher temperatures anddestroy nutrients.Steel-Cone BurrMillsThis type of grain mill can sometimes be operated by both hand orelectric power and offers the ability to adjust the fineness of the flourfrom fine to cracked.  Generally, the steel-cone burrwill produce flour at a relatively slow speed, but theelectric version is also relatively quiet to run.  Steelcone burr mills can make fine flours suitable forbreads, muffins, pastries, etc, but the flour may notbe as fine as stone or micronizing mills.  T h e s egrain mills can also mill most whole grains andbeans, but larger grains such as corn and beans willneed to be cracked first, and then run through again on a fine settingif you want flour.  Examples include the Family Grain Mill, Back toBasics hand mill, Jupiter Grain Mill, and Kitchen Aid Grain Mill.Micronizing Grain MillsMicronizing mills are exclusively powered by electricity and utilizetechnology that originally was developed for the pharmaceuticalindustry to derive fine, uniform powders.  Modifiedfor milling grains, micronizers are fast and capable ofmilling grains into very fine, powdery flour at lowtemperatures.  These mills tend to be louderand may take up more space than some ofthe previously mentioned mills.  Althoughthey will mill a wide variety of dry grainsand dry beans, they generally will only milla range of flours from very fine toslightly coarse as in cornmeal.  My per-sonal preference and baking experiencehas been exclusively with micronizing grain mills.Micronizing mills include The Kitchen Mill,Wonder Mill, and NutriMill.Selecting AMixerRather than hand mixing and kneading, many homebakers prefer tolet the mixing and kneading of bread be done with a mixer.Wholegrain bread dough is quite heavy and can easily burn out low poweredmixers, hand mixers, and food processors in a short period of time.The first heavy duty  mixer I ever saw was owned by a gal who proud-ly told me she  burned out three food processors before investing in thecurrent mixer which", "doc_id": "19eaeaf6-f613-4c34-8bd3-85068af7e77d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6dd6515f7c3e1e3ce6bb7327cbed98508a9030c3d770fdd4d80b10c5f8c8a815", "extra_info": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "12.

Allow to sponge for 15 minutes.  Add thehoney, oil, dough enhancer, salt and 4-5 cups  additional flour until thedough begins to clean the sides of the mixing bowl.  This is truewhether you are mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or using adough hook attachment with an electric mixer.Knead the bread by hand 7-10 minutes or until it is very smooth, elas-tic, and small bubbles or blisters appear beneath the surface of thedough.   It is a common mistake of beginners to add too much flour.When hand kneading, oil your kneading surface and your hands with1-2 tsp of oil to help reduce stickiness to avoid adding too much flour.Form the dough into 2 loaves.Allow the dough to rise in a slight-ly warmed oven or other warmplace until doubled in size, about30-60 minutes.  (Turn the oven onfor 5-10 minutes, turn off oven andopen door, allowing it to cool downto approx. 100\u00b0F.Then put thedough in the warmed oven andclose the oven door.)  Bake the loaves for 25-30 minutes at 350\u00b0F.  Preheating the oven is notnecessary.  Bread is done when the top, sides, and bottom are nicelybrowned in color, or 180\u00b0F to 200\u00b0F is reached on an instant-read ther-mometer.  Over baked is better than under baked.General Mixing Tips and Suggestions* Use warm water.  Best temperature is 110 - 120\u00b0F if using SAFInstant Yeast, otherwise 110\u00b0F maximum.  If you are not using Instant orQuick Rising Yeast like SAF, be sure to proof the yeast before using it bymixing the yeast with 1/2 cup warm water with a teaspoon of sugar orhoney and allowing it to sit for 10 minutes before using it.* Use the right amount of flour.Too much flour kneaded into thedough causes dry crumbly bread.  Because the moisture content of floursvary, yeast bread recipes will always call for a range of flour.With expe-rience you will learn to recognize when the right amount of flour has beenadded to the dough rather than relying on measurements alone. * Sponging is simply allowing the dough to sit in the mixing bowl toallow the flour to absorb the liquid.  Combine the warm water, yeast, and2 cups of fresh whole wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. Allow to spongefor 15 minutes.  This step gets the yeast off to a good start.  Set the timerif necessary.  Use the \u201cwaiting time\u201d to clean up your kitchen or fold thelaundry.  Don\u2019t worry if the sponge goes longer than 15 minutes.  The artof baking bread is flexible.  If the baby needs to be changed, or the mail-man rings the door bell, and life happens, relax; get back to the bread assoon as you can and don\u2019t fret.* Measure ingredients and mix the dough.  Measure the oil into aglass measuring cup before the honey.That way the honey slides out withminimal stickiness.  Then add the remaining ingredients and 4-5 cupsadditional flour.  Stir with a sturdy wooden spoon until the bread doughbegins to clean the sides of the mixing bowl.

Assemble yourbasic yeast bread ingredients:fresh whole wheat flour,salt, yeast, honey, vital gluten and filtered water.You are ready to get started!Step 2: Mixing the ingredientsPour the water into a mixing bowl and stir in the dry ingredients witha wooden spoon until they are moistened.  There is really no perfect orderfor combining these ingredients but below are some tips for insuring goodsuccess with your first efforts at baking whole grain bread. Step 3 through8 below will describe the kneading, rising, shaping, baking, and coolingsteps in more detail.Step 3: Knead the doughThis process will develop the gluten.The gluten is an elastic protein thatenables dough to hold it\u2019s shape whenraised.  The most difficult aspect of mas-tering bread baking is learning thekneading technique and knowing howlong to knead.  Here is how to recognizewhen the gluten is fully developed:  Thedough will be smooth and elastic.  Take a golf ball sized portion of doughand see if the dough is stretchy and does not readily tear.Add vital glutento improve the gluten content and texture of your bread.Tips forKneading the Dough By HandTry to get all the flour incorporated within two minutes of mixing soyou will have even gluten development.  Too little flour will cause thedough to be too sticky to work with, which is your signal to add moreflour.  Since whole grain flour absorbs moisture more slowly, be sure notto add too much flour, or, as you mix and knead, the dough will becometoo dry, resulting in crumbly bread.  Add more flour gradually, in 1/2- 1cup portions.  It takes practice to add the right amount.Arhythmic process called \u201ckneading\u201ddevelops the gluten in the  bread dough bystraightening the gluten strands and causingthem to become smooth and elastic.   Placethe slightly flattened dough all onto a light-ly floured surface, and fold the dough  overtoward yourself.  Press the folded dought o g e t h e r, pushing down and away fromyourself with the lightly floured heels ofboth hands.Give the dough a quarter turnand repeat the process by folding the doughand pressing away, turning and repeating.This \u201ckneading\u201d is a rhythmic motion, repeated many times. Knead the dough by hand 7-10 minutes or until it is very smooth,elastic, and small bubbles or blisters appear beneath the surface of thedough.  It is a common mistake for beginners to add too much flour.When hand kneading, if you will oil your kneading surface and yourhands with 1-2 tsp of oil, this will reduce stickiness and help you avoidadding too much flour.   If your dough is too sticky to work with afteroiling your hands you will need to gradually add additional flour.AFool-Proof Way to Knead YourBreadAn older, wiser woman told me how she determined if her bread wasadequately kneaded.  She said, \u201cSay the Lord\u2019s Prayer as you knead,making one kneading stroke per word and then repeating the prayer atleast twice.\u201dMany ladies have told me that this method alone solvedtheir dilemma of determining how long to knead the dough.With experience you will eventually master the kneading processand learn to \u201cfeel\u201d and recognize when the gluten is developed.Step 4: Recognizing When The Gluten Is DevelopedYou can recognize when gluten is fully developed by taking a golfball sized portion of dough and gently stretching the dough in oppositedirections using your thumb and forefinger of both hands.  If you canstretch the dough thin enough to see light through without the doughreadily tearing, you have sufficiently", "doc_id": "6a3b9708-6444-44cd-a215-d4213c3b5597", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ea1a0604ac935876266ac30537de3bed03af9141c8f451917026332cf9bea003", "extra_info": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "12.

More kneading after a certain point does not mean more glutendevelopment.  In fact, it is possible to over-knead the dough and, if thisdoes occur, the gluten begins to break down and the dough becomes asticky mess. Finish making the bread according to the instructions below.The fin-ished bread may be a bit heavier and denser than you like,  but I suspectthe bread you have made will smell wonderful and be delicious even if itis a bit heavy and dense.  Just view this as a \u201clearning experience.\u201d   As I have said before, thereare no failures in bread baking, only learning experiences.  Expect to havethem.   Bread that we call a learning experience is usually enjoyed by thefamily anyway, or it can be salvaged by turning the baked bread into crou-tons, bread pudding, bread crumbs, or feeding the ducks.If you find your bread heavier or denser than you and your familyenjoy,  you will want to add vital gluten into the recipe next time toimprove the texture of the bread.   Often, baking with Montana grownhard wheat (which is higher in protein content) may solve thatheavy/dense bread problem in the future.Step 5: Let The Dough Rise(1st raising - optional)When the gluten is fully developed, allow the dough to rise in agreased mixing bowl.  Cover the dough with a damp kitchen towel tokeep the dough from drying out.  This step is often called \u201cproofing\u201d (notto be confused with proofing the yeast).  Proofing is a baking term forallowing bread dough to raise, generally  outside of the oven.  Althoughthis step is optional, proofing will develop texture and flavor, glutenframework, and help make light, fluffy loaves of whole wheat bread.  Ifyou are in a hurry, this step can be skipped.The activity of the yeast ferments the flour, causing the developmentof carbon dioxide gas to develop.  The carbon dioxide is captured by thegluten which raises the bread.  The optimum temperature for yeast activity is 85-100\u00b0F so use aslightly warmed oven, top of the refrigerator, direct sunlight or any otherwarm place, if possible.  Otherwise, the first rising period done at roomtemperature will just take longer, which is nothing to be concerned about.Normally the first rising period  takes about 30-60 minutes.  (The firstrising of the bread can be skipped if you are in a hurry, but flavor andtexture of the bread improve with up to three risings.)  After the dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough, divideit into two equal pieces and shape the loaves.  Use 1 tsp. oil on yourkneading surface or on your hands when it is time to shape the dough.This keeps the dough from sticking and avoids using excess flour.Step 6: Shaping bread loavesAfter the dough has risen once and been punched down with yourfist (this deflates all the air bubbles), you will want to shape the loavesin a round cylindrical loaf shape the length of your bread pan.  It isimportant to get all the air bubbles out of the dough before shaping.  Thiscan be done by banging the dough a few times firmly on the counter.Make sure the loaf is nice and round and smooth before placing inloaf pans.  When I\u2019m content with the shape of my loaf, I put the dough,smooth side on top, into the greased bread pans and lightly grease the topof the loaf with oil or melted butter.  For the prettiest highest rising breadloaves, use 8\u201dx4 1/2\u201d loaf pans filled 1/2 to 2/3 full of bread dough.

Oncethis basic dough is prepared, you can fashion it into a wide variety ofbaked goods such as pizza, cinnamon rolls, bread sticks, onion cheesebread, and more!  Read on for a dozen or so of my ideas.  With practiceyou can create your own variations.Whole Wheat PizzaUse approximately one loaf of bread dough (11/2 pounds dough) for each pizza crust.  Ifyou are not baking the crust on a pizza stone,you will be much more successful if you pre-bake the crust for six to eight minutes at350\u00b0F, and then cover it with toppings of yourchoice.  Pre-baked crusts must be forked all over to release steamwhile baking.  Be sure to have all your toppings ready, or wrap andfreeze pizza crusts for future meals.Cinnamon Pull-ApartsPinch dough off into walnut-sized balls.  Dip in melted butter andthen roll in cinnamon sugar mixture (1 tablespoon cinnamon to 1/2cup sugar or Sucanat).  Place balls in layers (at least two layers deepor fill the pan one half to two thirds full) in a baking pan or bundtpan.  Let rise until doubled in bulk, then bake at 350\u00b0F for 25-30minutes.Caramel Nut Pull-ApartsMake caramel sauce by melting 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar,and 1/2 cup maple syrup in a saucepan. Add 1/2 cup chopped wal-nuts or pecans if desired.  Pour this mixture into the bottom of abundt pan or baking pan.  Place walnut-sized pieces of dough in lay-ers in the pan.

Avery hot oven is the key to forming the pockets.  If you have a pizza stone,by all means use it but make sure it is thoroughly pre-heated, otherwisean ungreased cookie sheet works, too.  Wrap baked pitas in a large terrycloth towel, directly after removing themfrom the oven.  While still warm, store in plastic bags.  They will contin-ue to soften up.  Then cut in half with your kitchen shears.Pita Bread Tips:1. A2 1/4\u201d dough ball equals about 1/4 cup dough.  Put the ball on afloured board and turn it over to coat both sides.  Using the large endof a pizza roller, begin rolling and turning the dough ball, to make anice round flat shape, about 1/8 inch thick.  (Apizza roller is a smallrolling tool that has a roller on each end.  It is easy to use because ofthe small size.)  As each pita is shaped, let it rise at least five minuteson the counter top.2. Bake four pitas at a time.3. Apizza stone is imperative if you want your breads to puff.  Apizzapeel is a wonderful tool to use for sliding the pitas from counter tocookie sheet or pizza stone.4. Leave the oven door closed until the pitas are done.  Opening the doorwhile baking will keep the pitas from puffing.\n6061\n", "doc_id": "533d7d39-5ed2-4887-b142-5ec1cee8420e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0b58d9a0dc9538701fbfe75c83feef3574285d93a7cd1b0ef3c9d3baed204c85", "extra_info": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "12.

Low pro-tein means low gluten content.  All wheat is not created equal, andpremium wheat will have a  higher protein content than less expen-sive wheat.  (Review Chapter 3, Know Your Basic Ingredients.) If you are using a low protein wheat, make a note to add vitalgluten to the bread dough in your next baking session to boost upthe gluten content.  Use 1 tablespoon vital gluten per cup of flouras a starting place.  You can increase or decrease the amount toyour preference with subsequent baking sessions. Another optionis  to use one to two cups of bread flour in place of whole wheatflour.Sometimes the cause of poorly risen bread is bad or weak yeast.  Ifyou suspect your yeast is out of date or old, here is how to proof(test) the yeast:  In a cup, add 1 teaspoon yeast to 1/2 cup warmwater (85\u00b0F) and 1 teaspoon sugar.  If the yeast isn\u2019t bubbling upto the top of the cup within 10 minutes, replace the yeast.Be sure to store yeast cool and dry.  Use moisture/vapor proof con-tainers.  I use a pint-sized canning jar and store the yeast in thefreezer.The yeast can be used in recipes straight from the freezer.Another possible reason for bread not rising well is underdevel-oped gluten.  Learn to recognize when the gluten is fully devel-oped.

Solution:When loaves sink in the middle, it means the bread structureis weak, and the bread has been over-risen.  Shorten the rising time.Whole grain loaves should only double in volume before beingready to bake.  Also, consider if you are using larger than ideal loaf pans.  Wholegrain breads rise best in narrower pans, 8\u201dx4\u201d pans are ideal.  Thenarrower width makes for higher rising loaves.  Wider pans, such as9\u201dx5\u201d, make loaves that spread more than rise.  It isn\u2019t wrong to usethe larger pans, but the results are not the same; my philosophy is touse what you have.Problem:My bread keeps turning out dry, even when I don\u2019t put asmuch flour in.  I get it to where it is a workable dough  and the bread isstill dry.Solution:  If the bread is still dry and you know you have been careful tonot add too much flour, you probably have low protein wheat.  Thesolution is to add vital gluten which adds moistness and improvesthe texture of the bread.  Start with 1/3 cup vital gluten for a twoloaf batch.  Increase or decrease the amount of vital gluten accord-ing to your taste preferences in subsequent baking sessions.Problem:I don\u2019t eat wheat anymore due to severe gluten-sensitivity.  Doyou have any good gluten-free bread recipes?Solution:There is a body of scientific research mentioned in theSummer 2006 edition of Wise Traditions Journalpublished byWeston A. Price Foundation that soaking the gluten containing grainsfirst for 12-24 hours will eliminate the gluten intolerance problem.(This journal can be purchased at www.westonaprice.org.)During the soaking process, enzymes, lactobacilli and other helpfulorganisms not only neutralize phytic acids (substances that interferewith digestion) but also break down complex starches and difficult-to-digest proteins, including gluten.  There are many testimonials of people using this soaking method torecover their health without total dependence on a gluten-free diet.Problem:I am having trouble with making bread dough in my mixer.The dough is always very sticky and I can\u2019t seem to get the textureright.  Solution:If the dough is sticky there is not enough flour.The trick tosuccess in a mixer is to add enough flour so the dough \u201ccleans thesides\u201d of the mixing bowl.  Then add a little extra flour (1/2 to 1cup). Remember to try and incorporate all the flour  in about twominutes of mixing time for even gluten development.  Begin to timethe kneading once the bread starts cleaning the sides of the mixingbowl.Remember, the amount of flour called for in ANYbread recipe is aguide.  Moisture content in flour varies depending on humidity andweather conditions.  The key is to add enough flour until the doughpulls away from the sides of the bowl.  It is less important to accu-rately measure the amount of flour in yeast breads, and more impor-tant to get the right texture/dryness.Keep in mind that whole grain flour absorbs moisture slowly;  some-times you will need to add a little extra flour in the beginning to com-pensate so the dough doesn\u2019t get so sticky you can\u2019t work with it.If your dough never gets elastic and you are kneading properly, theproblem is either low protein/quality wheat or it has been overknead-ed.  If bread is kneaded more than 10-12 minutes it may beoverkneaded, at which point the gluten starts to break down.The goal is to make the dough smooth and elastic and easily handled.Practice makes perfect.

The only adjustment I make isadding some vital gluten so the bread will not be too dense or heavyor dry.Problem:  My bread is dry and crumbly, and doesn\u2019t slice well.Solution:  Make sure you don\u2019t add too much flour during the kneadingprocess.  Sometimes low protein wheat results in dry bread.  Addingvital gluten helps \u201clighten\u201d the bread and make it softer.Add vitalgluten, starting with 1/3 cup per 2 loaf batch and increase the quanti-ty if needed.Sometimes over-risen bread will have a very coarse texture and does-n\u2019t slice well.  Reduce the rising time; make sure the dough only dou-bles in size before baking.I have found the Two-Stage Process (see Chapter 9), in which theflour is soaked for 12-24 hours before preparing the bread loaves,makes much moister bread.  Also, the use of honey  instead of sugarwill result in moister bread that does not readily go stale.9The Two-Stage ProcessDoes it make a difference and why? The two-stage process is a term coined by Sue Gregg, author of SueGregg Cookbooks, for a method of preparing yeast breads in which thegrain or flour is soaked, sprouted, or fermented for a period of time priorto kneading the dough in order to maximize the nutritional value ofwhole grain bread. Soaking, sprouting, or fermenting the flour or grain are methodsused traditionally by our ancestors for preparing grains, porridges, orbreads.  These slower, more gentle methods contrast sharply with mod-ern factory and commercial baking techniques.  Only recently hasresearch documented the chemical changes that occur using these slow-er methods and the corresponding health benefits. According to Sally Fallon and Dr. Mary Enig, in their bookNourishing Traditions, enzyme inhibitors, tannins, complex sugars, dif-ficult to digest proteins, \u201canti-nutrients\u201d (substances which put a strainon our digestive system and pancreas), and other factors in whole grainscontribute to a variety of digestive disorders.  It has been hypothesizedthat improperly prepared whole grains, consumed for a long period oftime, may contribute to increasing incidences of gluten intolerance, grainallergies, celiac  disease, chronic indigestion, mineral deficiencies, andbone loss. The slow process of soaking flour or whole grains in an acidic envi-ronment neutralizes phytic acid, which is contained in the bran and whichblocks absorption of minerals, significantly boosting the availability ofvitamin and mineral content to the body.  The authors  point out that,\u201c Tannins, complex sugars, gluten and other difficult-to-digest substancesare partially broken down into simpler components that are more readilyavailable for absorption\u201dduring the soaking, sprouting, or fermentingprocess.

(Many of our senior citizens may remember that in earliertimes the instructions on the oatmeal box called for an overnightsoaking)\u201d (pg. 452).My bread recipes do not reflect the two-stage process because Iencourage beginning bakers to master the basics of yeast bread makingbefore undertaking this soaking, sprouting, or fermenting method. Although I had started making fermented bread with a wild-caughtsour dough starter several years ago (one of the methods mentioned inNourishing Traditions), I found the very slow rising time resulted in verysour bread and the very long raising time was often not compatible withmy busy schedule.  Sue Gregg introduced me to the Two-Stage Processwhich I find works well with my schedule; in fact, I would consider thismethod somewhat of a convenience.  Bread that has been made using the two-stage process is moister forlonger periods of time, and stales very slowly.  Many people with healthissues such as sinus problems, gluten intolerance, and allergies havereported that symptoms have been relieved when using the two-stageprocess.TWO-STAGE PROCESS FOR YEASTBREADSAdapting Marilyn's Famous Whole Wheat Bread Recipe to MaximizeNutritional Value 1. Soak the whole grain flour in liquid, using 1 tablespoon of an \u201cacid\u201dmedium such as kefir, yogurt, buttermilk or whey for each cup ofwater called for in Marilyn's Bread Recipe.  For example, if a recipecalls for 6 cups water, use 6 tablespoons kefir, yogurt or buttermilkalong with the water.You can substitute  lemon juice or vinegarinstead if you suspect dairy intolerance.  Add the honey and oil called for in the recipe along with enough flourto make a thick batter.  Mix the liquid and flour ingredients only untilmoistened and then begin the \u201csoaking\u201d time.  Soaking/fermentationtime is done at room temperature.  For the Hand Method, use aboutfive to six cups whole grain flour.  Use 11-12 cups flour for the LargeMixer method. Twelve to 24 hours or more soaking time will yield the best results.The longer you soak the flour the more sour dough-like taste it willhave.  However, be flexible; soak the flour for as long as you havetime so that this process fits into your routine smoothly; any soakingtime improves texture, nutrition, and flavor.  Just mix the liquid andwater long enough to moisten the flour before the soaking timebegins.  This is a little bit like \"sponging\" however no yeast is used.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp cloth to prevent it fromdrying out. 2.

This two-stage procedure can be used with any yeast bread recipe.   I have received many positive testimonials about the two-stage processfrom experienced bakers.  Here is what one mom said about her experi-ence:\u201cI decided to try the 2-stage process for making your famous bread.  I LOVED it!  The bread was so light, you wouldn't knowit has mostly whole wheat flour in it!  My family hasn't reallyliked the all whole wheat bread I've made before because it wasso heavy and dry.  But doing the 2-stage process helps it be somuch moister and lighter!  I just wanted to share that I tried yourrecipe and we love it!  Thanks!!!!\u201dSheri Graham, KSConclusion When you have learned to use a variety of whole grains in your diet,and your family has accepted this change, then you might want to con-sider moving on to the new step of adapting your recipes to the two-stageprocess.  Sue Gregg writes in An Introduction To Whole Grain Baking, \u201cI sug-gest that occasional consumption of whole grains that are not processedby one of the three two-stage methods (soaking, fermenting, sprouting)is not likely detrimental to health and may contribute a plus, while thosethat are properly processed as the main dietary choice will be greatlybeneficial to health.\" (p. 14)Learning to prepare breads and grain products with slower methodsmay seem daunting or a bit intimidating or even overwhelming to abeginning baker just becoming acquainted with whole grains.

They also may help prevent cancer. \nBesides being nutritious, almond flour is also delicious, with a flavor and texture that \nadds not only moisture, but an extra dimension of taste to dishes it's used in. \nPopular uses for almond flour include piecrusts, cakes, pancakes , cookies, and other \nbaked goods. It is also often used as a substitute for breadcrumbs, such as when \nmaking meatballs or coating fish or chicken, or as a thickener in soups and stews. \nAlmond flour is also tasty when used for crackers and for \"crumbles\" over fruit cobblers \n(sugar, butter, and a cup of almond flour combined and crumbled over cobbler before \nbaking). \nAlmond flour is so nutritious and delicious, that many people sprinkle it over dessert \nitems such as ice cream, just to get every bit of nutrition and taste they can out of wh at \nthey eat. \nAlmond Flour Tips  \n\uf0b7 Almond flour is best kept refrigerated or frozen \u2014just make sure you let it thaw \nout before you use it. If you store it in the refrigerator or freezer, it will keep for 6 \nmonths. \n\uf0b7 If there is one down side to almond flour, it may be the cost. While it can get ve ry \nexpensive when you buy it in the store, buying it online  will save you a little \nmoney. \n\uf0b7 If you've never made anything with almond flour before, you might want to start \noff with a recipe that specifically calls for almond flour. However, if you're anxious \nto try a \"regular\" recipe with almond flour substituted, you can try a direct \nsubstitution (i.e., a cup of almond flour for a cup of whole flour). Just be \nprepared \u2014it might not come out exactly as you hoped, and you might have to try \na bit of experimentation to get the exact results you want. \n\uf0b7 Baked goods made with almond flour are a little more delicate than your typical \nbaked goods. Let them sit for a few minutes after baking before you try to get \nthem out of the muffin tin or off of the pan. \nNow that you know how good almond flour can be \u2014and how good it can be for you \u2014\nhow about a tasty recipe that uses some?

Sure, at first it seems like a secr et, \nbut really, it\u2019s all about the technique you use for your particular biscuit recipe.  \nFlaky and buttery, fluffy and moist, these are all terms bakers and foodies use to \ndescribe their ideal biscuit. But can a gluten free biscuit also have these qualities? \nAbsolutely yes. It just takes a bit of trial and experimentation with flours to get the  \nperfect gluten free biscuit  to compliment your meal. \nThese \u201csecrets\u201d that I\u2019m revealing are not so much secrets as lessons. There are things \nto do and things not to do. But they are all little techniques to help your gluten f ree \nbiscuits rise to the occasio n. \nSecret # 1  \nThe type of flour you use determines the outcome of your finished product. Sounds like \na no-brainer, right? Well this is vitally important for baking gluten free. For example, if \nyou want fluffy, white biscuits, as opposed to a brownish color, use superfine white rice \nflour. Brown rice flour can also be used, but they will have a hint of brown. Coconut flour \nlends a great taste to biscuits, but may be a little too sweet for a dinner meal.\n \nSecret # 2  \nThe gums that gluten free baking usually require are not always necessary in biscuit \nrecipes. Often, your biscuits will turn out just spectacular with a combination of some \nbaking powder and salt mixed with gluten free four and starch. This may not be th e case \nfor every recipe, but for a general rule of thumb, xanthan gum and guar gum can often \nbe omitted . \nSecret # 3  \nThe type of fat you use can make a world of difference in your biscuits. This is regarding \ntaste and even texture sometimes. Butter is going to result in a buttery, almost sweet \ntaste in your biscuits. Shortening can also be used \u2013 it\u2019s going to lend more height to \n", "doc_id": "c66fceb3-199a-466d-8918-1af21830d028", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "de6c832fb58488dfb9aa1d2ecfbfec936dcf53a24791693a1d7a5bdd24d99a26", "extra_info": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "02. 15 Gluten Free Bread Recipes to Bake, Roll and Sweet Bread Your Way into the Holidays author Gluten-Free-Bread.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1896, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "13eac800-d3ca-40b8-9eb3-e5e37899b260"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea84e05e-08eb-4cfc-b433-f3519c19ea15": {"__data__": {"text": "12 \n\u00a9 2014 www.Gluten-Free-Bread.org  All Rights Reserved. \n your biscuits and they may also be softer. Shortening is flavorless so the end result will \ntaste a bit different than your butter counterparts. The final verdict between the two is if \nthe recipe calls for butter or margarine, use the butter option. If the recipe calls for any \ntype of fat (as in, it gives you options), choose the one that will compliment the rest o f \nthe meal best. \nSecret # 4  \nYou don\u2019t have to make drop biscuits. This is a little secret I discovered while multi -\ntasking. Just because the recipe is directing you to drop the biscuits on the cookie sheet \ndoesn\u2019t mean you have to. Instead, if you prefer round, cookie -cutter biscuits, make \nthose instead. The secret is that because gluten free biscuit dough will be quite sticky, \nyou\u2019ll have to do some creative positioning. Take a piece of plastic wrap and dust a little \nflour on it. Lay your biscuit dough on it and cover it with another piece of plastic wrap. \n(You might need a little more flour). Gently roll out the dough to a nice thickness \u2013 about \n\u00bd inch or so. Use a floured cookie cutter  to cut out your biscuits. Slide a metal spatula \nunderneath the dough and place your biscuits on the baking sheet. A nice, easy way  to \nget beautiful round biscuits! \nSecret # 5  \nPlacing the biscuits close to each other helps them rise higher. However, in most biscuit \nrecipes, not just the gluten free ones, the directions state to place the biscuits 2 inches a \npart to bake. Well, if you want to see some nicely risen biscuits, try placing them closer \nto each other. Allow them some space, but if you try for about \u00bd inch apart, they w ill be \nable to grab onto the other biscuits, thus baking up sky high and light. \nWhether you like light and fluffy or tall and flaky biscuits, your gluten free baking  \nadventures just got even more interesting with these secrets to yummy biscuits. Th e \ngreat thing about biscuits is that adding cheese or herbs can take a basic, plain biscuit \nand transform it into a savory gluten free bread  worthy of serving to guests. Or add in \nsome cinnamon and serve them with honey butter and you have a delightf ully delicious \nbreakfast treat. \nEnjoy your biscuits! \nLike this article?

Gluten Free sourdough bread actually has significant health benefits because \nit is easier to digest than ordinary breads; the proteins are already partially broken down \nbefore the bread even hits your digestive system. It also helps keep your blood sug ar in \ncheck by not causing the spike that other types of bread do. \nThe secret behind the bread\u2019s uniq ue flavor lies in fermenting the flour in a sourdough \nstarter that you can keep for as long as you want to keep feeding it. However, not a ny \nflour can be used to make this type of bread, in part because of the wide variety of \nflavors available, but mostly because of their starch levels. \nIt is necessary to use a flour mix that has a good ratio of protein to starches  in order to \nproduce bread that has a nice, fluffy texture and that doesn\u2019t fall apart. Another \nalternative to mixing your own flour is to buy it pre-mixed, a good idea for beginners to \nGluten Free bread baking. \n", "doc_id": "be79b909-6377-41cc-a7ef-8a940dd3f7af", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e48bb75b9d72693fdecee3d77545618b320dab8c890a456b6f54184cf64b6b38", "extra_info": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "02. 15 Gluten Free Bread Recipes to Bake, Roll and Sweet Bread Your Way into the Holidays author Gluten-Free-Bread.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1245, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "f7aca628-dbfe-4086-8b2c-6f12135ddf38"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8d75ceb-6773-4dd9-87e1-e8044d9f4c69": {"__data__": {"text": "16 \n\u00a9 2014 www.Gluten-Free-Bread.org  All Rights Reserved. \n The Sourdough Starter  \nEvery loaf of sourdough begins with a starter. You make this flour-and-water \ncombination ahead of time and let it sit in your fridge until the flour has suffici ently \nfermented, and this is the base of the bread that adds that tangy taste we a ll love. \nThe process takes about 5 \u20137 days, but once your starter is ready you can continue to \nfeed it and it will be ready- to-go whenever the mood strikes you to make another loaf of \nbread. \nTo make it, simply whisk together \u00bd cup of Gluten Free flour mix with \u00bd cup water in a \nnon-metal bowl or wide-mouthed jar and put it in the fridge. Then, over the ne xt 5\u20137 \ndays you\u2019ll add \u00bd cup of the flour and a 1/2 water about twice per day at regular \nintervals. \nWatch the starter as you continue to feed it; after about three days after you be gin the \nstarter, bubbles should begin to form around the top and sides of the mixture. If  you do \nnot have bubbles, you will need to start feeding the starter three times pe r day, still at \nregular intervals. \nYou will be able to tell that you sourdough starter is ready when it forms a n ice round \ndome within about three hours of your feeding it. At this point you can make your loaf.  \nIt can seem like a long process at first, but don\u2019t worry\u2014 a nice loaf of fresh sourdough \nbread is definitely worth the effort. \nMaking the Bread  \nWhen your starter is nicely fermented, you can make your first loaf of sourdough. Many \nGluten Free bread bakers understand that since Gluten Free flour can be trickier than \nwheat flour, beginners may not get the results that they are looking for on the first t ry. \nDon\u2019t let this discourage you though, just continue to feed your starter and try again.  \nIngredients:  \n2 cups Gluten Free flour mix \n\u00bc teaspoon cream of tartar \n\u00bc cup sugar \n1 teaspoon salt \n2 teaspoons active dry yeast \n2 cups sourdough starter \n3 tablespoons butter, melted (or any oil of your choice) \n1 \u00bd cup milk, heated to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit \nDirections:  ", "doc_id": "e8d75ceb-6773-4dd9-87e1-e8044d9f4c69", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "eb5ecf8baef0da0341e46d45fd6bb02c27e8d616358324e2cf6062876f3370ec", "extra_info": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "02. 15 Gluten Free Bread Recipes to Bake, Roll and Sweet Bread Your Way into the Holidays author Gluten-Free-Bread.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2063, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "eee7ad52-3db5-4a52-93ca-d3ef24b51fe8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcee6523-62ef-47b0-ad45-24141cc25f14": {"__data__": {"text": "17 \n\u00a9 2014 www.Gluten-Free-Bread.org  All Rights Reserved. \n 1.

Although all the ingredients \nmay seem like they would make a great cornbread, and many of them are very similar, \nsometimes the smallest thing can make a big impact. For instance, did you know if you \nput your baking pan in the preheating oven for a few minutes it gives your cornbread a \nnice crusty bottom and sides? And if you let your batter rest for a minute, it make s the \ntop rise nicely? Its things like that that can take your cornbread from ho-hum to Wow ! \nGluten free cornbread is another story though. If you\u2019ve made it unsuccessfully before, \nthen these terms should be familiar - dryness, grittiness, general lack of taste. \nSometimes even adding more butter doesn\u2019t help. Fortunately, there is hope. There are \nsome things you can do to create the best, most springy gluten free cornbread in the \nworld \u2013 and no one will even know its gluten free! \nRemember to preheat your oven.  \nPreheating is important as it ensures your oven is at just the right temperature before \nyou put your labor of love in there to bake. And, going a step further, if you want a nice \ncrisp to your gluten free cornbread, then preheat your pan as well. \nFat is a good thing.  \nFat and cornbread go together like cinnamon and cinnamon rolls \u2013 you can\u2019t have one \nwithout the other. Some form of fat is essential for a nice, moist cornbread. Now, the re \nare some exceptions to this rule \u2013 there are recipes that are low-fat by design. In this \ncase, the fat has been replaced by something else. I may be premature here, but I\u2019ve \nnever found a low-fat gluten free cornbread recipe that tastes like this one. \nDon\u2019t get overzealous with the mixing.  \nEven though your gluten free recipes can\u2019t get tough due to overworking the g luten, \nthey can still get tough due to over-mixing.

The white part of the peel is quite bite r \nand could offset the sweetness of the muffin. \n", "doc_id": "453d25e9-1439-41e3-a381-8aeaea576c09", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e67b781be9848f8d23c2b4920cbabbc5ef3139ccdd3f8d079224db7cfbde06cd", "extra_info": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "02. 15 Gluten Free Bread Recipes to Bake, Roll and Sweet Bread Your Way into the Holidays author Gluten-Free-Bread.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1314, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ce973b8c-722b-4409-b2b6-52fd4bd2ebc3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "49cca3f0-5f57-4b6d-9fb2-1a80e270e551": {"__data__": {"text": "32 \n\u00a9 2014 www.Gluten-Free-Bread.org  All Rights Reserved. \n Gluten Free Lemon Cranberry Muffins  \nIngredients:  \n\uf0b7 1 cup organic cranberries, minced \n\uf0b7 6 eggs \n\uf0b7 1 tsp lemon zest \n\uf0b7 1 Tbsp. lemon juice \n\uf0b7 1/2 cup coconut oil \n\uf0b7 6 Tbsp. maple syrup \n\uf0b7 1/2 cup coconut flour, sifted \n\uf0b7 1/2 tsp baking soda \nDirections:  \n1.

It\u2019s easily the most popular binding agent and most Gluten Free \nrecipes feature it as a crucial ingredient. \nHowever, recently, there has been some controversy surrounding xanthan gum as it \nappears to cause allergy-like symptoms in certain individuals. Add that to the fact that \nit\u2019s highly processed, its use is being viewed as contradictory to the healthy and hol istic \napproach that is sometimes embraced by Gluten Free bakers. \nSo it leaves us with a problem or perhaps a challenge. Are there alternatives to xanthan \nand if so, how can you use them in your baking to perhaps avoid the negative  health \neffects that using xanthan may bring? We\u2019ll look at some alternatives in this article.  \nChia Seeds \nChia seeds are an excellent binding agent and can absorb up to 12 times their own \nweight in water. They form a gel-like substance which improves the consistency of \ndough and locks in moisture when baking breads, pastries and cakes. \nThey can be ground, although this is not necessary for the binding effect to take pl ace. \nChia seeds are also extremely high in fiber and can have a laxative effect. They are \npopular replacements for xanthan gum  because while they have a nutty flavor, it\u2019s mild \nand tends not to interfere with the flavor of the baked goods they are add ed to. \n", "doc_id": "fa38ac8f-3373-47b2-a952-71264c9933da", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4711a98fdd1f4a856dea21c759343dd980681f1ae26e528c8e08e16f8ae21262", "extra_info": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "02. 15 Gluten Free Bread Recipes to Bake, Roll and Sweet Bread Your Way into the Holidays author Gluten-Free-Bread.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1518, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "7925f219-9446-4c36-9a77-dc3fa9ae8547"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8df522f-5618-4fe3-b40e-a0bc67e186fa": {"__data__": {"text": "45 \n\u00a9 2014 www.Gluten-Free-Bread.org  All Rights Reserved. \n Substituting xanthan for these is simple as you use a 1:1 ratio. Just use the same \namount of chia (in weight) as you would xanthan and you\u2019re all set!  \nPsyllium Husk  \nPsyllium husk or psyllium fibre is a relatively new binding agent which is typically used \nas a xanthan substitute in breads. It has been scientifically proven to improve the  \nstructure of Gluten Free dough and improve the texture, volume and rising of gluten free \nbaked bread. \nIt is typically found as a dietary fibre supplement in most health stores and is used b y \nathletes to lower cholesterol. A 5% psyllium fibre flour mix is best for baking breads (1 \npart psyllium to 19 parts of flour). \nKonjac Powder  \nAlso known as Glucomannan powder, Konjac powder is ground up konjac root which \nhas been used in Asia as a dietary fiber for several hundreds of years. Like Psyllium \nfiber, it is used as a supplementary source of fiber as well as a thickener. \nIts high fiber content lends it numerous health benefits which include the reduction of \nblood cholesterol and a lower bowel cancer risk. It also helps control blood sugar levels \nbut its binding properties are most relevant for our purposes. \nWhen used in baking, you can use the same amount of Konjac powder as you w ould \nxanthan gum (1/2 teaspoon per cup of flour for cakes and breads). For other bake d \ngoods like flatbreads or tortillas, you can increase the amount of Konjac you use to \u00be \nteaspoon per cup of four to get the desired consistency. \nFlax Seeds  \nFlaxseeds are extremely popular in baking and also as a health supplement (flaxseed \noil). They are a great binding agent and are easily found (because of their popularity ). \nOn top of all this, they are cheap to buy! \n \nIn their natural form, flaxseeds are not very useful as a binding agent. They  have to be \nground first and then mixed with hot water . The water has to be boiled first and then \nmixed with the flax to form a gel like paste known as \u2018slurry\u2019 which is then added to \ngluten free flour for baking breads and cakes. \nFor substitution, use the same weight of ground flax as you would xanthan gum. Then \nmix it in twice the amount of water (2 tbsp. of ground flax mixed with 4 tbsp. o f hot \nboiling water). \nAgar Agar  \nAgar Agar is a seaweed derivative which acts as a stabilizer, thickener and binding \nagent.

Baking can be one of life's great \npleasures, and if you are cutting refined sugar in your diet then sugar substitutes and sugar alternatives \noffer a lighter way to enjoy sweet treats. Here's what you need to know before using them.  \nFirstly, they can be expensive and if you don't know the best way to incorporate them in bakes you may \nspoil your hard work. BBC Good Food\u2019s nutritionist Kerry Torrens pointed out that: \"Using refined sugar in \nbakin g isn't all about sweetness \u2013 it\u2019s responsible for that delicious texture and crumb, that lovely golden -\nbrown colour and it helps extend the storage time of your bake. That's if your cake hangs around long \nenough! Sugar also keeps bakes moist, so sugar -free versions may need to be wrapped before storage \nto prevent them drying out.\"  \nWhat are the top tips for sugar -free baking?  \n1. Whole fruit  \nNature\u2019s natural sweet treat, whether fresh, frozen, dried or pur\u00e9ed, fruit adds flavour, moisture and \nnutrients to  your bakes and is amazingly versatile.  \nBananas are an obvious choice but don't forget other exotic fruits, like pineapple and mango. One of the \nkey considerations when using fruit is to make sure it is as ripe as possible so you optimise its natural \nsweet ness. Be prepared for some trial and error before you get your favourite recipe to work. Replacing \nrefined sugar with, say, an apple pur\u00e9e, is clearly not a straightforward swap, so you\u2019ll need to play \naround with the amount of fluid and the dry ingredient s before you get the combination right.  \nDried fruit like dates, sultanas, prunes and apricots are concentrated sources of sweetness, rich in fibre \nas well as nutrients including iron and potassium. They make a great choice for boosting the sweetness \nof a r ecipe and when used as a pur\u00e9e they add extra moisture and stickiness. Where possible use whole \nfruit, with its skin intact \u2013 that way you'll be benefiting from the addition of fibre and extra nutrients.  \n \n \nGluten -free lemon drizzle cake  \n \nGive it a go with our  sugar -free banana bread , baked banana cheesecake  and cinnamon apple \npecan pudding . \n2. Fruit pur\u00e9es and syrups  \nOptimise the natural sweetness of fruit, like dates, by making a pur\u00e9e  or syrup and use instead of treacle, \ngolden syrup, maple syrup, agave syrup, rice syrup or honey, all of these are classed as  'free' sugars  \u2013 \nthe type we are advised to cut back on.  \nSyrups add a gooey texture to traybakes, cookies and tarts, which is hard to mimic. However, fruit pur\u00e9es \nsupply sweetness and moisture and make a useful alternative.

Vegetables  \nPopular veggie choices include carrots, parsnips and beetroot \u2013 these all w ork surprisingly well in sweet \ntreats, as do sweet potatoes, squash and even courgettes. A great tip is to combine vegetables, like \nthese, with an ingredient such as ground almonds so you can mimic that crumbly, naturally sweet, cakey \ncrumb.  \nYou can also c ombine veggies with fruit and other sugar substitutes as we\u2019ve done in our  sugar -free \ncarrot cake  and squidgy chocolate sandwich cake . \n4. Xylitol  \nIf you're looking for a low -calorie, low -GI substitute that will give you a straight swap for sugar, xylitol may \nbe the answer. Despite its s ynthetic -sounding name,  xylitol  is extracted from hardwood trees and the \nfibres of some fruit and vegetables. It looks and tastes like sugar \u2013 although some people experience a \nslight after -taste. With fewer calories than refined sugar and a low glycaemic index (GI) it has less of an \nimpact on blood sugar levels, which means you can enjoy that sweet taste without the resulting 'rush' that \nregular s ugar might give you. For this reason, xylitol may be a useful alternative for people \nwith diabetes  and because it has a reduced calorific value it may also help those looking to lose weight.  \nThere\u2019s another important benefit with xylitol and that is it doesn't cause dental decay. You can use it as a \nsubstitute in many r ecipes on a one -to-one basis, but not those which use yeast as a raising agent. You \nshould also be aware that cakes sweetened with xylitol don't tend to colour very much, but that\u2019s not a \nproblem for coffee or chocolate cakes. One word of warning: xylitol can have a laxative effect so go easy \nwhen you first try it \u2013 a slice of cake shouldn't be an issue though. Be warned, if you have a dog in the \nfamily, keep it well away from products made with xylitol \u2013 it's highly toxic to our canine friends.  \nGive these diabetic -friendly cakes, made using xylitol, a go:  sugar -free lemon drizzle \ncake , Moroccan orange & cardamom cake  and sugar -free victoria sponge cake . \n \n5. Erythritol  \nPopular among those following a  keto diet , erythritol is seen as the next -generation sweetener following \nxylitol and it shares many of xylitol\u2019s properties, including be ing kind to the teeth. Found naturally in fruit, \nthis processed powder is a low -calorie sweetener and tastes like sugar but because it's metabolised \ndifferently by the body it doesn\u2019t spike  blood sugar levels  in the same way.  \nErythritol works well in bakes but because it is not as sweet as sugar you do need to use a little more \u2013 \nroughly 30% more. It doesn\u2019t caramelise and it doesn\u2019t dissolve as well as su gar, so if you\u2019re looking for a \nmoist, gooey sweet bake you may need to add another sweetener to the mix.  \nAlthough  less likely to cause dige stive issues  than xylitol, if you eat too much of it you may experience \nbloating, wind and diarrhoea.  \nTry keto -friendly baking with our  keto chocolate cake  and keto brownies . \n6. Stevia  \nIf you're cutting down on calories and want to make a sugar -free cake, try stevia. Made from the leaves of \na plant that contains sweet -tasting compounds called steviol glycosides, stevia is up to 300 times sweeter ", "doc_id": "ca552aae-82c9-4911-90a5-ec29043e4ded", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cbc9f443a98710327eed1e987c1303e020a2cc8630265e442e9181a386f8d75b", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Sugar_free_tip.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3237, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4a279a14-b85f-49cf-aad8-12e3f71c80d6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "90c6d3bc-e8d5-4b9d-a097-8cd2eec1e038": {"__data__": {"text": "than sugar, so the amount you use is tiny in comparison. What's more, it  doesn't impact blood sugar \nlevels  or cause tooth decay.  \nStevia is available as granules, tablets or in liquid form and is stable at high temperatures, so it can be \nused in bakes and puddings. You will need to use a specially adapted recipe, though, because swapping \nthe quantity of sugar for stevia is not a stra ight swap. This is because stevia doesn\u2019t caramelise or work \nwell in recipes where sugar is key to the structure and texture of the bake.  \nAs well as being calorie -free, stevia contributes nothing in the way of nutrition, so it's what we call a non -\nnutritiv e sweetener \u2013 it supplies that sweet taste and that's all.  \nGive stevia a go in our fabulous  keto pancakes . \n7. Agave syrup  \nSyrups like  agave  are popular ingredients for a gooey flapjack or a sticky ginger cake \u2013 but whether you \nopt for golden syrup, maple syrup, honey, agave or  rice syrup they're all classed as 'free' sugars \u2013 the \ntype we should be cutting back on. If you're using these alternatives then strictly speaking your bake is \nnot sugar -free, but you may, depending on which you use, be benefiting from some nutritional \nadvantages like trace vitamins and minerals. However, because the amount is so small it's unlikely to \nhave any impact on your health.  \nEnjoy the sweetness of agave in our  healthier flapjacks  and lower sugar cookies . \n \n8. Coconut sugar  \nCoconut sugar is made from the sap of the flower buds of th e coconut palm tree, it\u2019s less processed than \nrefined sugar and as a result retains some trace nutrients, although the amounts are negligible.  \nFlavour -wise, coconut sugar has the taste of caramel and works well in recipes that would typically use \nbrown sug ar. It can be used like for like to replace sugar but don\u2019t be under any illusions, coconut sugar is \nstill just that \u2013 another form of sugar and a costly one. It is available as a syrup or in crystallised form.  \n9. Palm sugar  \nPalm sugar as its name suggests  is made from palm sap, like coconut sugar it has caramel flavours and \nis available both as a syrup and in crystallised form. Popular in Asian cuisine, palm sugar may also be \nused in cakes and bakes. That said, don\u2019t forget this is a minimally processed fo rm of sugar so will \ninfluence blood sugar levels in much the same way.  \n10. Jaggery  \nThis is an unrefined version of sugar and as such is made from sugar cane or date palm. It is available as \na block, liquid or as granules and can be used as a direct replace ment.  \nJaggery has gained a bit of a health \u2018halo\u2019 because being minimally processed it retains some  trace \nnutrients , but these amounts are negligible and don\u2019t be fooled, this is still sugar.  \n ", "doc_id": "90c6d3bc-e8d5-4b9d-a097-8cd2eec1e038", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5b78252b3f1e66d25ffd92d806be1331dfcb916b150bc0565e82a2a12b603d21", "extra_info": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Sugar_free_tip.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2751, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "91a3d4b4-1c1a-41a4-8bb6-fb282de20690"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bacd5e3b-df62-43dd-a393-b4872a7dfdf8": {"__data__": {"text": "11. Chocolate  \nIf you love the flavour of chocolate why not make a savvy swap? It\u2019s worth remembering that even dark \n70%-cocoa chocolate may contain sugar, as can cocoa powder. We love to use raw cacao nibs and raw \ncacao powder instead of chocolate in many of our recipes. Raw cacao has a rich flavour, so you may only \nneed a small amount and it is a source of minerals including iron and magnesium. It wo rks well in cakes, \ncupcakes, tortes and cookies.  \nCheck out this speedy  keto mug cake  with peanut butter.  \n12. Flour  \nSwapping refined white flour for wholemea l may not seem like an obvious sugar swap but refined white \nflour is digested quickly \u2013 this means it's converted into glucose that will aggravate blood sugar levels. \nUsing wholemeal flour instead slows the rate at which your body absorbs all forms of suga r. \nWe used wholemeal flour to make our  vegan strawberry pancakes . \n13. Vanilla  \nIn the grand scheme of things vanilla extract isn't too bad, but if you're keen to avoid processed products \nopt for vanilla pods instead. Although they are a little more pricey than extract, it's easy to make each pod \ngo a little further. Once you've remov ed and used the seeds, keep the pods and use them to infuse milk, \nyogurt and cream, as well as stewed fruits and pur\u00e9es.  \n14.

Naturally flavour your homemade compote with spices such as cinnamon, \nvanilla or ginger, or make a fruit pur\u00e9e using mango , pineapple or apricots.  \n \n15. Toppings  \nUse lighter toppings in place of icing, buttercream and frosting \u2013 these little extras can more than double \nthe calories per portion. Instead, sprinkle your cake lightly with cacao powder, cinnamon or ground \nginger. Use a cream cheese topping flav oured with citrus zest, or a fresh cream filling with some seasonal \nfruit. \n \n ", "doc_id": "bacd5e3b-df62-43dd-a393-b4872a7dfdf8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a2f4cdab02ad5ee067040299bc452605728214680b74b3af3b5b40e7c5a3c9e6", "extra_info": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Sugar_free_tip.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1950, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "518fbcab-8d5e-4b72-80c8-29656fa11ca1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "48da7744-c18f-42ca-b4aa-9a50c1cda944": {"__data__": {"text": "20 Bakery Chiang Mai The sweet line is not to be missed!

The role of oxidants in bread making  systems is that of \nimproving the gas retention abilities of the dough thro ugh better gluten \ndevelopment. With the addition of suitable oxidizing  materials to the dough we \ncan reduce the development time for doughs fro m many hours to less than 10 \nminutes and achieve most of the changes in the mixer.  If we use a high speed \nmixer we can achieve full dough  development in less than  5 minutes.

Slow acting \nones such as potassium  bromate have been used widely  and were com mon \nthroughout Europe. The faster acting ones such as potassium iodate, calcium \niodate, and azodicarbonamide are more wi dely used in USA.  However with a \ngreater awareness of food additives by the general population, and a greater \nunderstanding of their fu nction, a number of changes to legislation on Europe \nhave been made with the result that we are left with ascorbic acid ( or Vitamin \nC or E 300) as the sole oxidizing  agent for use in the baking industry.  At present \nthe level of use is quantum sat is =use as much as required. These  oxidizing  \nagents are commonly added as part of the bread improver, but they can also be \nadded to flours by the miller. Bakers need to be aware that they do not over -\ndose bread dough by adding oxidizing  agents from several sources . \nReducing agents . Reducing agen ts make dough more extensible. They  are \ndeliberately added to 'weaken' structure in specific products.  The major \nmaterial used in bread dough is an amino acid known as L -cysteine.  It can only \nbe used at low levels in improvers but by reducing dough resis tance to \ndeformation it helps in molding  and shape forming, such as rolls and baps, \nwithout structural damage.  L-cysteine can also be used in pan breads at  low \nlevels where its ability to reduce resistance can help reduce streaking  caused \nby molding  faults . Other ingredients such as deactivated yeast and proteases \nhave a similar effect.

Enzymes in bread  \nCereal \u03b1 -amylase is naturally present in flour. It breaks the starch into simple \nsugars to feed the young plant. Levels will vary depending on the quality of the \nwheat and the weather conditions during harvest. Cereal \u03b1 -amylase  can be a \nbeneficial bread improver, but at high levels can cause stickiness, mos t \nnoticeably in sandwich breads; the levels are m easured in seconds using \nHagberg Falling Number (HFN), where 60s is a very high level and 450s is a very \nlow level. Flour mill ers control the level in flour by blending the wheats. The \nterm alpha -amylase is used to describe a range of enzymes, which are capable \nof breaking down damaged starch granules into materials known as dextrins \nand in combination with beta -amylase they will  produce maltose.  Alpha and \nbeta -amylase work in combination. Beta -amylase attacks the ends of the \namylose and amylopectin chains breaking off individual maltose sugar \nmolecules. Most wheat flours contain adequate levels of beta -amylase so it is \nthe alpha -amylase that controls the reaction. Additions of alpha -amylase to \ndoughs via improvers and even in flour mills are preferred in the fungal rather \nthat the cereal form.  This is because the fungal form is inactivated at lower \ntemperatures in the baking proc ess and reduces the risk of the formation of \nhigh levels of sticky dextrins.  Excess cereal \u03b1 - amylase  reduces bread quality. \nCereal alpha -amylase is produced during the growing cycle and can achieve \nquite high levels if the period around harvesting is wet.   The dextrins which are \nproduced by the action of alpha -amylase on damaged starch are sticky and if \ntheir level is high enough in the finished bread they build up on the slicer \nblades and can reduce their efficiency to such an extent that loaves will \ncollapse.  \nThe other widely used enzyme is hemicellulase, also known as pentosanase and \nxylanase. This was added to the list of permitted enzymes in 1996 and has \nalready achieved widespread use.

Perhaps you finally decided to approach them about their lack of \ntact, but received the response: \n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way I am. People need \nto get used to me.\u201d\nContrary to what most people \nthink, \ncommunication style  \nis not exclusively determined by \npersonality. It is also affected by the choices we have learned \nto make by watching others, trial and error attempts, parental influence and a variety of life experiences. Communication style is a choice. For example, we choose words, how loudly we speak, timing of the conversation and the strategies we use to influence others. These choices affect whether or not people hear our point or are distracted by our behavior. When we make the wrong communication choices, people have two thoughts:\nIf our improper communication style becomes the listener\u2019s \nfocus, the point we are trying to make is ignored.Unfortunately we are not always conscious of the choices we are making. We have all had conversations in which our emotions dictated our behavior. Also, we are often focused on our intent behind the message and fail to monitor how we are delivering that message. For example, during your last conversation with someone, were you aware of what your facial expression was saying? Much of our communication behavior is difficult to self-monitor. Most of our communication choices have become habit. We are not thinking of how we are being perceived, but instead are communicating on impulse. We are not thinking about the listener\u2019s opinions, only about what opinions we feel compelled to state. Therefore, learning \nthe \nfour communication styles  and the positive and \nnegative impacts of these style choices on others is critical to:\n\u2022 the clarity of our communication;\n\u2022 the quality of the connection we have with others;\n\u2022 our credibility and;\n\u2022 the potency of our influential messages.\nEach style can have both positive and negative impact \ndepending on how the style is used and in what situation you use it. For example, it is most effective to be open with others in most situations, but there are times when you may possess confidential information that cannot be divulged. Obviously if you were to reveal what you know, trust would be violated with the people whose secret you were supposed to keep. Trust is a critical factor in making decisions about how to communicate with others. Think of someone whom you do not trust. Your communication with that person is limited, guarded and skeptical. Trust changes everything in relationships. This is the main reason why making effective communication behavioral choices are so important. When people are focusing on how poorly they are being treated in an interaction, they do not accept the point being made \u2013 even if that point provides the solution to every problem on the planet! Why trust someone\u2019s idea when you do not trust that person to communicate clearly and respectfully with you?\nOpen style communicators  use trust as a guide \nfor their choices. Ask yourself: \u201cWill my actions, my style and my words improve or maintain trust?\u201d If your answer is yes, then you most likely have chosen your approach carefully and will be communicating in a way that is clear, respectful and influential. In stressful situations, however, we often fail to ask this question and say whatever is on our minds, justifying our lapse in tact with the excuse that a lack of time prevented us from stopping to think about our impact on others.An open style communicator also understands that it is the listener who determines the success of the interaction. The point of view of everyone in the conversation is considered. Paraphrase is used to clarify, empathize and keep the conversation focused on the real issue. Information is shared with appropriate relevance, detail and self-disclosure.", "doc_id": "1f48cde6-f4b5-41a2-b570-f84f272891be", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "79971c68ceaa96de69ce4fcc9cbb343c6254b7349d08f8c4a0631c07180e21f5", "extra_info": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4101, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "1f788076-9e06-453d-8ff3-048bf6d9d3a6", "3": "e136a03b-3344-4d56-aa40-8f9ab0547133"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e136a03b-3344-4d56-aa40-8f9ab0547133": {"__data__": {"text": "the real issue.

Have you ever walked out of a meeting regretting that you said everything you were thinking and feeling without filters?

Sometimes the \ntime needed to analyze all of the information and provide an answer takes longer than people expected or longer than the deadline allows. The subsequent explanation of that answer will be very detailed: starting with background information, then describing all facets of the problem, then revealing potential sources of those problems, then stating several solutions one-by-one until we have eliminated the ones that will not work and then describing in detail how to implement the solution that will work. Have you ever sat through one of those presentations? How much of all that detail did you absorb? Talk about TMI! This style is close to my heart, however, because the best example I have experienced of this style is my amazing mechanical engineer father. As I write this commentary, today is his 101st birthday. Yes, you read that right \u2013 one hundred and one years old \u2013 with a mind that is just as sharp and analytical as it ever was. People sometimes think that it is his age that prompts his long explanations, but I assure you it is his detail-oriented thinking process that drives \nthe beginning-to-end-of-the-story approach. \nWe tend \nto communicate the way we think. For those \nof us who have these detail-oriented tendencies, we need to \nunderstand that not everyone has either the patience or the desire to grasp everything we are presenting. We need to learn to edit. Once we do this, it will be easier for us to focus on the most important information, make decisions faster, speak up more quickly and ensure our opinions are being heard and considered. Remember: too much detail buries your point.\nIn a crisis situation brevity is critical. We must be decisive, \nconcise yet descriptive, calm and focused on action. Communication choices that distract people from this action could have disastrous consequences. Unfortunately, people \nwho use this \nblind style incorrectly believe that the \ncrisis justifies using any type of behavior that incites action, \nincluding intimidation. However, others often react with resistance to the power play. The last time someone said to you: \u201cYou have to\u2026\u201d how did you react? A person who uses this style to the extreme has a clear picture in mind of how the world ought to be and how people in the world ought to act. They will demand that their methods be adopted, unfortunately without clearly describing those methods. After all, the picture is completely clear to them, anyone with a brain should be able to figure it out. And they will make this statement about people publicly. Bluntness is mistaken for openness. Listening to others\u2019 opinions is considered a waste of time. \nThese tactics may work in the short term, but long-term \nadversely affect credibility. No one respects a bully.When people are uncertain of how to respond to inappropriate \nbehaviors or unfamiliar situations, they often choose to hide \ntheir true opinions and feelings. \nFor example, how would you respond to the question: \u201cDo \nthese jeans make me look fat?\u201d Obviously we will consider the \nrelationship with the questioner when determining the degree \nof openness in our answer out of concern for their feelings. \nThere are many situations in which this degree of hiddenness \nis appropriate, such as customer service. Customers may be \nyelling and blaming us for their own mistakes. As customer \nservice providers, we must remain calm and be conscious \nof our word choice (even though they are not conscious of \ntheirs). On the inside we are furious and upset, but on the \noutside we are smiling, listening and negotiating a solution. \nThis is appropriate use of the \nhidden communication \nstyle . Revealing our true feelings would only escalate the \nsituation. But when this style is used to extreme, the full \ntruth is not consistently revealed, causing problems with trust.

But beyond that, it is important not to approach or communicate with others in the way we like to be treated, but approach them in the way that suits them the best; the Platinum Rule.\nSo how do others like to be treated? That can be a challenging question. As I mentioned, everyone likes to be treated with dignity and respect. That is your ticket in the door, but we all are unique and have personal preferences as well. For example, in the workplace some people like to work alone, others like the energy of groups. Some like to thoroughly analyze the situation before making a decision and others like to go with their gut. Some people have a focus on the team while others are more task focused. These are just a few ways we can differ from our co-workers. Before you start looking at others, it\u2019s a good idea to first determine what kind of preferences you have.\nThe Personal Interaction Style Profile\u00a9 from PPS International \nis a great place to start. I have been utilizing this assessment in my programs for years. This is not a psychological assessment; it is behavioral. There are 58 yes/no questions asking what your preferences are when you interact with others. It\u2019s quick, easy to understand, but most importantly, easy to apply in the workplace. After taking the assessment, you will fall into one of four categories:The Expresser style  is very open and expressive \u2013 both \nverbally and nonverbally, meaning that people in this style tend to be open books. They will tell you anything you want to know, at any time. They are usually the people telling a joke, having fun and enjoying whatever situation they may find themselves in. They have no problem speaking their mind, which if they are not careful, can get them into some sticky situations. Because of their upfront, tell you everything kind of style, they can be overwhelming at times to others who don\u2019t share their interests. They are excellent promoters and can get others on board with their enthusiasm.\nThe \nDirector style  is very clear and direct. They are \nfocused on getting things done and getting the desired results. \nThey are fast paced, have no problem taking charge of a situation and telling others what to do. They feel their time is valuable and limited. In their effort to get things done, they may not realize how they are coming across to others or just who they may have left in their wake. They like clear, succinct information. They tend not to make time for socializing or relationship building. They will tell you that they are here to get the job done and that is what they have every intention of doing. They don\u2019t mind conflict and come across very confident (sometimes arrogant) if they are not careful.\nThe\n Analyzer style  is very focused on data and \ninformation. The more facts, the better. They prefer to work \nalone and review all the necessary stats before making a decision. They do not like to be wrong and can sometimes over analyze a situation, causing delays, for fear of making a mistake. They like clear parameters and checklists. They prefer step-by-step instructions and procedures. They can have a difficult time with change. In a meeting, they tend to be quiet, gathering all the information they can, but often have a tough time being put on the spot to make a quick decision. They tend to be black/white thinkers. The data either supports it or it doesn\u2019t. The emotions of others, or the people side of a decision, almost never is considered in their equation.\nThe \nRelater style  is your ultimate team player.

How about the people you work with? Live with? It\u2019s an interesting and important question to be asking yourself. After you have determined your style and the style of those people who are important to you, you may notice that you are a lot more like some people than others. For example, I am an Expresser and I usually enjoy time with other Expressers. Their approach to interacting is similar to mine, we tend to make decisions in a similar way, and value the same approaches. You may notice that as well; you get along well with those people who are the same style as you.\nNow think about the people who are very challenging to you. \nWhat style do you think they are? If it is a different style than you, this is your first clue as to what they may need from you (that you may not value yourself). For example, since I am an Expresser, my approach differs greatly from the Analyzer style. So when I meet with an Analyzer, in order to give them \nwhat they need, I need to \n\u201cflex\u201d my style . I need to tone \ndown the emotion, be less demonstrative with nonverbal body \nlanguage and focus on the facts. I may even need to prepare my information and send it to them ahead of time so that they can review it. I need to be more clear and concise with my information and cut out the \u201cfluff\u201d that I may like to share in my reasoning. That is how I \u201cflex\u201d my style to work more effectively with an Analyzer.\nNow let us go through each style and think through an easy \nscenario \u2013 being in a meeting \u2013 for each style. If I am another style, what do I need to do to \u201cflex\u201d my style to a Director in a meeting? Start on time, prepare an agenda with quick bullet points, focus on the results of what we are trying to accomplish, end on time, minimize small talk and cut out the fluff.\nHow about a meeting with a Relater? Ask how they are doing \nand how their family is doing, making time to listen and show empathy. Express your concern about the team. Give them the reasons why a decision is being made. Provide information on all the perspectives and opinions that have been considered.\nA meeting with an Analyzer? Send them the information \nto be covered ahead of time. Provide all the relevant data and statistics. Be clear and systematic in your explanation. Minimize emotion and small talk. Give ample time for questions and discussion around the facts and give them time to formulate and share their decision.\nLast but not least, how would you \u201cflex\u201d to an Expresser \nin a meeting? Create an informal setting. Be flexible. Add humor, smiles and show emotion. Tell them they are doing a good job and are an asset to the team. Allow ample time for conversation, while showing patience and interest in their story.Some of the above \u201cflexing\u201d behaviors may be very challenging for you depending on your style and how you approach a situation. But when you are trying to be influential with someone, giving that person what they need is the key to great communication. I need to provide others with what they need in order to work more effectively with me. What is important to me may not be as important to others. I need to be very aware of that, especially with those people who I find very challenging to work with. Just try it.\nIncluded below is a summary of the various styles:\n  \u2022 Expressers - Are easy to read, very social, show   emotion, need recognition\n\u2022 Directors - Are difficult to read, like action and getting   things done, need results\n\u2022 Analyzers - Non-emotional, very precise and    systematic, need accurate facts\n\u2022 Relaters - Good listeners, focus on relationships, team   players, need harmony\nThe better you are at reading others and providing them what they need, the better communicator you will be.

Shared meaning happens when everyone pictures the information as similarly as possible. Unfortunately, many conversations can be characterized by the quote above. Certainly miscommunication can be caused by talkers who are insufficiently descriptive; the pictures they are trying to convey look more like murky water than a clear vision of meaning. But, as is often the case, the listener has failed to exert the amount of effort that is required to interpret meaning correctly.\nMany people view listening as a passive activity: \u201c Just sit right \nback and you\u2019ll hear a tale\u2026\u201d The implication is that the talker has full responsibility to ensure that meaning is shared. It is true that people ask themselves \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d before focusing their attention. Talkers do need to provide motivation for the listener to choose to hear the message. But notice: \nlisteners \nchoose  the focus of their attention. Listening is an \nactive choice, requiring considerable effort. Unfortunately our \neffort is often misguided. For example, have you ever sat in silence at a family dinner nodding your head dutifully while an in-law droned on about the origins of silverware? You probably told yourself you were being a good listener for the sake of family harmony. But, your silence symbolically communicated that you were fascinated by a long, drawn-out explanation of the most appropriate number of tines on a fork! The truth is you were fascinated by how someone could talk incessantly and devour turkey at the same time. Martyrs do not make good listeners.\nGood listening skills give us power in conversations. \nUnfortunately, people often view this power as an all-or-nothing concept. Either we sit silently biting our tongues or we interrupt, debate and dominate. Those are the only choices we \nbelieve are available. \nEffective listening skills  give us \nthe power to avoid these extremes.\n Listening skills give us the power to calm an emotionally-charged conversation, keep the conversation on topic and ensure that everyone\u2019s opinion is considered even if everyone does not agree with that opinion.\nThe first step to becoming a powerful listener is to recognize \nand overcome ineffective listening habits. How many of the following statements represent your listening habits?\n\u2022 When I know someone well, I assume I know what they will \nsay before they say it.\n\u2022 When someone proposes an action, I immediately start planning what I will do.\n\u2022 When I disagree with the point being made, I immediately form a rebuttal and start to debate.\n\u2022 I have no patience for people who lead up to their point instead of giving the \u201cbottom line\u201d first.\n\u2022 I decide whether or not a topic is relevant to me within the first few seconds of the conversation.\n\u2022 I often focus on the example itself and miss the point that the example is illustrating.\n\u2022 I feel that I haven\u2019t really participated in a conversation unless I have added my comments about what others have said.\n\u2022 It is difficult for me to listen to someone who is less knowledgeable than I am.\n\u2022 I completely tune out people whom I don\u2019t trust.\n\u2022 I am sometimes so focused on what the other person thinks of me that I don\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying.\nEach of these statements represents a common problem in focusing while listening. The trick is to be aware that the lack of focus is occurring at the moment it is happening. Since most of our communication behaviors are unconscious habits, this realization can be difficult.\nA lack of focus while listening most often results in interrupting \nothers. This happens because as we are listening to someone talk, we are also talking to ourselves about what we\u2019re hearing.

That is why there is a second level of listening that allows us to ask critical decision-making questions about the information. Understanding the message from the talker\u2019s point of view means that I am able to describe in my own words the essence of the talker\u2019s main point. This paraphrasing \nis often referred to as \nreflective listening skills . \nWe are acting as a \u201cmirror\u201d for the talker, reflecting back the \nmessage as we understand it.\nReflective listening is very powerful. Consider the following \nexamples:\n1. You are being given confusing instructions and paraphrase \nwhat you are hearing. The talker eventually becomes more concise.\n2. Someone is very upset and, even though it sounds like a personal attack against you, you calmly paraphrase their frustration and ask in what way you can assist in resolving the situation.\n3. A sarcastic comment has been made. You laugh about the joke but then paraphrase the serious point being made within that joke and redirect the conversation to uncover the hidden meaning of the comment.\nIn all three scenarios you have taken control of a difficult situation and redirected the focus of the conversation to a much more productive and rational interaction. That is the power of good listening skills.\nLearning to paraphrase first after all of these years of \ndefending ourselves first and then straightening out the misunderstanding later, is not an easy task. In fact I consider it to be one of the most difficult communication skills I teach. In elementary school we learn to question what we hear in order to be good consumers of information and avoid believing empty promises and exaggerated claims. Of course this is important to learn, especially in today\u2019s society. We do not want our children believing everything they see in the media or read on the Internet. Unfortunately that means \nwe have learned how to accomplish \nStep #2  in listening \n(evaluate the message) before we learn how to paraphrase and accomplish \nStep #1 (understand). Learning to paraphrase \nas adults feels artificial and awkward. \nIt is also difficult to change a long-held habit. But with practice, \nthe skill can be used and our personal power and influence can be enhanced.\nSome important guidelines to consider when paraphrasing are:\u2022 Do not become a \u201cparrot\u201d who restates everything the \ntalker says. Paraphrase means capturing the essence of the main point. Besides, it would be ridiculous if someone tells you \u201cYou\u2019re the dumbest person I\u2019ve ever met\u201d for you to repeat, \u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is I\u2019m the dumbest person you\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Instead you would say: \u201cObviously I\u2019m not understanding what you\u2019re saying. This is what I thought I heard you say\u2026\u201d\n\u2022 When you are unable to determine the main point, acknowledge the emotion: \u201cThis is obviously frustrating so let\u2019s take it one step at a time to figure out how to fix this.\u201d Do not, however, say \u201cI know how you feel\u201d even if you have experienced a similar upset. This is their moment to experience strong emotion, not yours.\n\u2022 Keep the paraphrase neutral. Remember this is your first response to what you are hearing. Use the power of paraphrase to keep the conversation calm. Avoid putting evaluation in the paraphrase, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so worried about this.\u201d\n\u2022 Delay responding until you really do understand. Listen for the moral to the story. Or listen for the period at the end of the sentence before jumping", "doc_id": "b2ed453d-e27f-4903-ba36-2f4ce7343287", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4a2d31ace88e68d307c430643d3c4b1c93a915a8d5fbc85fb00c1e0a938d26b7", "extra_info": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3768, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "168b18b4-bb25-4a07-b0a6-70b3a8aaee67", "3": "82681212-f246-45ae-871d-6ff7dec97104"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "82681212-f246-45ae-871d-6ff7dec97104": {"__data__": {"text": "to the story. Or listen for the period at the end of the sentence before jumping in.\n\u2022 Match your paraphrase style to the talker\u2019s style. If they are detail-oriented, paraphrase with detail. If they are \u201cbottom line-oriented,\u201d paraphrase succinctly.\nWith trial and error practice, you will begin to see the advantage of slowing down conversations to truly understand everyone\u2019s meaning. Think of how much time is wasted in conversations where everyone is so busy stating their own case that no one realizes they are essentially agreeing with one another. Think of how powerful a person is who can keep a conversation issue focused and who does not react defensively. Being the listener in an interaction is not the passive, helpless position many believe it to be. Good listening skills influence the success of the conversation. That is powerful.Step #1 Understand \nthe message from the \ntalker\u2019s point of view, then\nStep #2 Evaluate \nthe message for its \nrelevance, veracity and persuasiveness.\n BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "82681212-f246-45ae-871d-6ff7dec97104", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "674b0945462a8212e5567ec0e927ef7163e5862c3749436159036dc7a0e89471", "extra_info": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3688, "end": 4711, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "168b18b4-bb25-4a07-b0a6-70b3a8aaee67", "2": "b2ed453d-e27f-4903-ba36-2f4ce7343287"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "18eac03d-962c-4918-a153-a920a4d2c429": {"__data__": {"text": "WHAT DOES NONVERBAL \nLANGUAGE REVEAL ABOUT YOUR \nCOMMUNICATION STYLE?\nWritten By: Kent State Facilitator Christine Zust\nOne of the most powerful \ncommunication tools you possess \nis your nonverbal language, or body \nlanguage. Yet all too often people are too busy to pay attention to what their actions say about them. \nWhat others see/feel/experience in \naction guides their interpretation \nof your personal style. Be mindful of the delicate interplay between verbal and nonverbal language. The \nkey to successful communication \nis to ensure that your verbal and \nnonverbal language are in alignment and consistent.\nA few years ago, I coached a corporate client on her \ncommunication style. I\u2019ll call her Nancy. Part of my coaching process included interviewing several of Nancy\u2019s co-workers to understand her better. I quickly discovered a common thread throughout the interviews. Here\u2019s what was happening:\nNancy was a very powerful female executive. When she led meetings, she wore glasses and leaned forward. She was quite efficient moving through an agenda. Towards the end of the meeting, she would remove her glasses, throw them on to the table, lean back in her chair, cross her arms, and ask the question, \u201cDoes anyone have anything else to add?\u201d What do you think happened? No one offered anything. Surprised? Co-workers interpreted Nancy\u2019s nonverbal language as this: She was done with the meeting. She really didn\u2019t care if anyone had anything to offer because that\u2019s what her nonverbal language communicated. When I shared this story with Nancy, she was shocked. She had no idea that she was sending mixed messages. Her verbal language didn\u2019t align with her nonverbal language. She said one thing, yet her physical behavior communicated the exact opposite. \nAfter learning this, she readjusted her behavior. She \nremained leaning forward, glasses on and arms open, which \nmeant she was still engaged with the group.\nNonverbal language  is considered as the most honest \nform of communication because the body rarely lies. When you say one thing and do another (when your verbal and nonverbal language are not in alignment), people will believe the nonverbal first. When your verbal language and nonverbal language are in alignment, you are in accord.When psychologist Albert Mehrabian studied attitude several decades ago, he found that 93% of the attitude that is communicated comes from tone of voice, inflection, \nfacial expressions and body language. Only 7% of attitude \nis communicated with words. The old adage, \u201cActions speak \nlouder than words\u201d rings true in this case. It\u2019s not just \nwhat  \nyou are saying, it\u2019s also how  you are saying it.\nKnowing this, what does your nonverbal language say about \nyou? Is it working for  or against  you? Is your verbal and \nnonverbal language consistent or are you sending mixed \nmessages? How you silently communicate reveals to others if you want to do business with them. It also shows them how interested you are in learning about and fulfilling their needs. We communicate nonverbally in six different ways. Let\u2019s take a closer look at these nonverbal communication tools that have great impact.\nFacial expressions/eye contact.  With \nabout 100 muscles in your face, you have the capacity to express more than 60 emotions, with six primary emotions such as fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise and \nanger at the core. Think about that. One of the most powerful parts of your face that you use to communicate is your eyes. They say, \u201cThe eyes are the window to the soul.\u201d People who master eye contact reap the rewards. Consistent, engaging eye contact positions you as confident, at ease and interested. Use a relaxed, steady gaze and be careful not to stare at the other person. Pupil to pupil eye contact is the most intimate form of communication. Looking directly at someone with sincerity reveals that you are open and engaging in your communication style.

Your level of confidence \nis communicated through your body stance and \nposture. Your posture communicates if you are confident, uncomfortable, shy or arrogant. What does \nyour posture say about you? Stand erect, shoulders back, chin up and chest open, with your weight evenly distributed to both feet. Do not slouch. Slouching symbolizes indifference or weakness. On the flip side, don\u2019t be too puffed up or people will think you are egotistical and self-important.\nGestures. Gestures can either support or \nsubstitute verbal language. They can also conflict with or detract from what is being said. Be aware of what hand gestures you are using. If you have a tendency \nto over-use your hands (too much or repetitive gesture), your gestures could be distracting your message.\nMovement.  How you move through a space \ncommunicates your mental state. Are you in a hurry, not feeling well, not interested or preoccupied thinking about something else? Those emotions \nshow. A woman in one of my seminars (I\u2019ll call her Jessica) shared a story with me. One day, a co-worker told Jessica in confidence that the department assistant, Stacy, thought she didn\u2019t like her. \u201cI love Stacy!\u201d Jessica said. \u201cWhy does she think I don\u2019t like her?\u201d Her friend shared what Stacy had told her. Every morning when Jessica arrived at work, she walked into the department, briefcase in one hand, coffee in the other and rushed to her desk. Stacy would say, \u201cGood morning!\u201d every day, yet Jessica didn\u2019t hear her because she had too much on her mind. Thankfully, Jessica\u2019s co-worker was smart to share with her what Stacy had said. The next morning, Jessica stopped and acknowledged Stacy with a \u201cGood morning\u201d in return. Sometimes we are so mentally preoccupied or too busy doing our thing, we don\u2019t realize how others are interpreting our movement.\nObjects/attire. The objects that you surround \nyourself with communicate who you are. Those objects can be your attire, office d\u00e9cor, even the car you drive. They are all part of your exterior image. \nWhat people \u201csee\u201d helps to define who you are as a person. Wearing a stained tie, having untrimmed nails, wearing a wrinkled blouse, all send messages about you to other people. As a professional, you want to look your best.\nSilence.  Silence is a powerful form of nonverbal \ncommunication. Unfortunately, many of us, either in conversations with colleagues or in presentations, are compelled to fill every second with sound. Think \nof how much more powerful President John F. Kennedy\u2019s historical \u201cAsk not\u201d speech was because he used silence. \u201cAsk not (pause) what your country can do for you (pause). Ask what you (pause) can do for your country.\u201d The effective use of silence in the form of pausing allowed the audience to absorb his message. Most Americans feel uncomfortable with silence. It feels awkward to us. We don\u2019t know what to do with ourselves. The only way to get over that uneasiness is to raise your comfort level and embrace silence. Use silence to add influence to conversations or client presentations. Silence does several things for you \u2013 it gives you time to collect your thoughts and stay on track, it lets the listener digest your message, it wraps a statement in power and it gives you some extra time to \u201cread\u201d a client\u2019s response.\nNONVERBAL LANGUAGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA\nAmerican workplaces have become quite diverse, with employees representing just about every corner of the globe. Nonverbal communication exists in all cultures around the world, however, meaning is not universal.

Conflict often deteriorates from a discussion of the issue into a confused power struggle.\nEmotions interfere with our ability to identify and maintain \nfocus on the issue during conflict. The reason we are so eloquent after the conversation is over is because emotions have subsided and rational thought is now in command of our thinking. Now we know exactly what we should have said. Sometimes the emotion subsides quickly, allowing us the immediate opportunity to identify the real issue, make amends and resolve the issue. Sometimes the emotion lingers, however, resulting in grudges, plans for evening the score and counter attacks. When this happens, the original issue may be lost in an on-going drama that can last a lifetime.\nEmotions are a powerful force. Keeping our focus on rational \nthought while experiencing strong emotions can seem like a superhuman feat. The good news is that we can train ourselves to switch from emotional impulses to rational problem solving and keep our communication issue-focused during the conflict.\nThe most important step is to understand what the \u201cissue\u201d \nreally is so that you recognize it when you hear it. In many cases, conflict conversations center around three types of issues:\n1. Misunderstood Information\n2. Difference of Opinion\n3. Actions/Behaviors\nIn the first  category, the problem is often created by either \nthe wrong information or by everyone not having the same information. This conflict is easy to resolve if we can simply recognize the lack of shared information or incorrect facts. This sounds simple, but how many times has an argument lasted for thirty minutes before someone finally recognized each person was arguing from a position based on different information? Asking for the background knowledge of each person\u2019s position can unveil this problem and lead to faster resolution. The focus changes from who is right to what is right. That is the real issue.\nThe \nsecond  category is more difficult. In this situation, \neveryone has the same information but views it differently. \nSome may view certain facts as more relevant than others. Some may have a different sense of urgency about acting on the information. People can become very attached to their opinions about what they know. After all, we are actually debating each person\u2019s view of the world here. If we do not keep the conversation focused on the information itself, the focus is then on who is right. \nIn this category we may need to \u201cagree to disagree.\u201d This \nis fine, but this is not as far as it goes. We can\u2019t just say we disagree and leave it at that. We must find a way for us to live with the fact that we disagree. \n 330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        12 ", "doc_id": "4ac7e1e3-3c91-431f-82e0-32ad5fa9f1e7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7e34150068af0df45db3b2f7e95e98f8bf1cb180861ca0b10b2a83beb81ff754", "extra_info": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3182, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "1b0be760-7c47-4bca-92e5-bd5773f7b26a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "befec446-bfab-4550-8b07-3648d2e154f5": {"__data__": {"text": "For example, if you and a family member are of opposite \npolitical mindsets, agree to disagree but then figure out how you will act as a result of this disagreement.

That\u2019s how silly it can get when the focus is on who is winning, not on how to resolve the real issue \u2013 which, by the way, is the fact that we disagree.\nCategory \nthree  (action/behavior) is the most difficult type of \nissue to address. When someone does something we don\u2019t like, \nwe are hurt, angry and often determined to get even. The key \nto keeping an issue-focus in this type of conflict is to separate the person from the choice of action. Visualize it this way: Think of someone you love dearly. Have you always approved of every choice of action they have taken? Probably not. But you continue to love them despite the fact that they did something that bothers you. This is what is known as detachment. Detachment allows us to understand a person\u2019s mistake and focus on a better choice of action. When detached, you address the behavior, decide what should be done differently, provide a chance to make a better choice and celebrate success when a better choice is made. You do not label them a horrible person simply because they make a choice you don\u2019t like and then treat them unkindly in return. What we are doing is standing up for ourselves and setting boundaries.\nSetting boundaries with people is a struggle for many of \nus. Detachment allows us to empathize with the stresses a person may be experiencing, while stating that being sarcastic when they talk to us is not acceptable. Some people allow unacceptable behavior from others because they focus too much on the excuse or reason for the behavior without ever stating that the behavior itself is not acceptable. They then \nbecome resentful when the behavior persists. Others have no \ntolerance for any behavior that fails to meet their expectations. \nThey then either refuse interaction with that person or show their disdain for them in many symbolic ways. Separating the person from the choice of behavior allows us to remain \nrespectful and dignified in our approach to others, even those \nwe don\u2019t like. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d you may ask. Why not just treat them the \nway they treated me? Because: \n\u2022 People are often unaware of their own behavior, but will \ndetermine your inappropriate reaction to be the issue.\n\u2022 You work with this person every day, like it or not. \n\u2022 Other people are watching you in order to predict how you will treat them under similar circumstances.\n\u2022 When you deal with the actual issue, you make it possible to move on with your life instead of dealing with the daily drama of who\u2019s winning.\n\u2022 Because the world doesn\u2019t get any better by adding more animosity to it.\nPick a reason, any reason. Temporarily it might feel better to \u201cput them in their place,\u201d but you have just established the \nrules for how dysfunctionally the two of you will interact from \nthis point forward\u2026possibly forever. \nWorse yet, there are three stages that conflict will go through if \nwe do not stay focused on the issue.

Everything becomes a competition: who is working harder, how many times one person cleaned the cat litter box versus the other, who has the bigger computer monitor. You get the picture.\nWhen the score is perceived to be uneven for a period of \ntime, then Stage 4 (Undermining) begins to surface.

No one remembers what started the conflict at this point. No one really cares. It is winner take all. Communicating in a respectful and issue-focused way? Forget about it. How can you stay focused on the issue when you can\u2019t remember what it is? Hopefully you can see the effect that keeping focused on the issue has in not only the immediate conversation, but also in the long-term relationship. We are better equipped to set boundaries with people, stand up for our beliefs and influence others when we remain issue-focused. It is not an easy task, however. \nWe need to learn how to identify the issue, word our \ncomments correctly and respond in an issue-focused way, despite the fact that the other person is approaching us from \u201cbelow the line.\u201d We must decide that maintaining our dignity is more important than showing disdain or winning. We need to fight our emotional tendencies to place blame, engaging in problem-solving instead. \nThe ability to focus on the issue takes practice and, in heated \ndiscussions, what seems like super-human strength. But, wouldn\u2019t you rather put in the effort to learn how to focus on the issue and move past it, rather than constantly asking \nyourself those \n\u201cWhy-didn\u2019t-I-handle-it-better\u201d  \nquestions?\n 330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        14   BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "0097eea2-3a64-48b4-a837-d13e021ec6d9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "99f2857c024927f1a89d985688ce74d8dc2ad78d9963baacad226588717dde32", "extra_info": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2441, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "93ffe002-35f6-4c5a-b254-0fea43f3ef9b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8287119-c5bf-47c5-b36f-837e6d4a4b3b": {"__data__": {"text": "GEN Y , MILLENNIALS AND GEN Z: \nDO YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE?\nWritten By: Kent State Facilitator Deborah Easton\nBy now you have probably heard something  about \ngenerational differences. The information is everywhere: \nmagazine articles, news media, Internet blogs and corporate training programs. There are research institutions who are devoting entire divisions to studying the Millennial generation. There is even a TV show titled \u201cSurvivor: Millennials vs. Gen X.\u201d The question now is not whether you have heard about generational differences. The question is \u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d\nAround the year 2000 many studies were published about the \nunique phenomenon of several generations in the workforce at the same time. This phenomenon occurred because: \n1. People are living and working longer and \n2. People are entering the workforce at younger ages. \nConsider these examples: Many Baby Boomers state that \nthey will not retire until they have something else important to do. High school interns are working in professional jobs for an entire summer and not just performing \u201cmake-the-coffee\u201d types of tasks, but actually doing what a professional in that line of work does. And when Baby Boomers do retire, not all of their positions can be filled with experienced employees, aka Gen X, because Gen X is the smallest population of all of the generations. This means that younger employees have greater opportunities to be promoted into decision-making or management roles faster than ever before and are, therefore, influencing the workplace earlier than previous generations had the opportunity to do. Obviously how they view \u201cwork\u201d matters.\nMany of the early resources on generational differences \nexplained this phenomenon well and helped us to understand how shared historical experiences affect our mindsets about the world in which we live and work. Many articles and corporate training programs still use these resources. However, these sources have limitations:\n1. They often fail to mention that two people who were born \non the same day may have experienced history differently due to gender, race, religion, geographical location, etc. 2. The books describe generational differences that existed at that time. This is a starting point, but should not be considered to be the full story. A lot has changed since 2000. For example, America has its first black president. Skype and FaceTime allow families to stay connected in more intimate ways than technology of the past allowed. The economy experienced a recession. There have been many changes in history that created changes in our mindsets, especially September 11th. \nUnderstanding generations means understanding how changes in society affect people. And the world is changing at faster and faster rates, requiring us to keep pace in this understanding. This is not intended to divide people. But by recognizing how our past experiences affect our perceptions, we can actually interact more proficiently and compassionately. Perception affects the choices we make. When we see people handling the same situation so differently, we tend to perceive this as a personal conflict. Rather, it is simply diversity of approaches based on past experience.\nIt is essential to understand these rapidly changing influences \nand not believe all of the negative stereotypes. Not everyone born after 1980 is the stereotypical young person who has no direction in life or sense of responsibility and is trying to \u201cfind themselves\u201d by hopping from job to job. Many (who, yes, are living in their parents\u2019 basement) have a clear career path and believe that paying off student loans instead of paying money for rent is a responsible decision. Others in this generation are all by themselves, halfway across the globe, making the world a better place. Some of these choices are because of individual characteristics, but some of these differences are because of the timing of when they entered the workforce and the stability of the economy at that time. We must understand that just because people are younger than we are, they are not all alike. Remember: only a small percentage of Baby Boomers were actually members of the hippie movement.\nMany discussions of the post-1980 population lump everyone \ntogether and call", "doc_id": "c8287119-c5bf-47c5-b36f-837e6d4a4b3b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ee8a2492fd9a1fda9e1bd9bf82be5fe97c3320ebe0143a7d9ec9beeb2c202732", "extra_info": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4274, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "404112d4-b41a-4240-a6ad-9d6db7f39203", "3": "593fc855-1c00-401b-ba8f-43d0387cb53a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "593fc855-1c00-401b-ba8f-43d0387cb53a": {"__data__": {"text": "movement.\nMany discussions of the post-1980 population lump everyone \ntogether and call them all Millennials. Increasing numbers of research studies, however, are recognizing that even a five to seven year difference in age can create significantly different mindsets. Some of these differences are, of course, due to phase-of-life differences \u2013  those in high school versus those who are married with children for example.          However, because society, technology and education practices have changed so rapidly since 1980, mindsets of the younger generations have changed rapidly as well. For example, how old were you when you received your first cell phone? There is a difference in mindset about the constant use of technology if you were in college when you bought your first phone to keep in touch with friends, versus if your parents gave you your first phone at the age of ten to keep track of you and keep you safe.  \n WWW.KENT.EDU/YOURTRAININGPARTNER         15 ", "doc_id": "593fc855-1c00-401b-ba8f-43d0387cb53a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4804dde25e0d30b9a06e5dfec0368eb99575703945a91014de32912b08ca7b86", "extra_info": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 4187, "end": 5165, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "404112d4-b41a-4240-a6ad-9d6db7f39203", "2": "c8287119-c5bf-47c5-b36f-837e6d4a4b3b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b884c25-a385-466d-a9b1-3092be31245a": {"__data__": {"text": "Change happens so quickly that researchers use varying \nbeginning and ending dates to establish generational boundaries. These dates are often chosen because of the researcher\u2019s focus: population growth, historical event, economic change, technological change, etc. Based on a number of factors many researchers are now describing the post-1980 generations in three groups: (The dates listed here are an average of several studies.)\nBased on listening to the comments of participants while \nfacilitating \u201cGenerations at Work\u201d training programs for thousands of people over the past ten years, I agree with these delineations. For example, many participants in the Gen Y category have said that they may have started out exhibiting the traits that were attributed to early Millennials, but now that they have been in the workforce for a while, they believe the description of Gen X fits them more aptly. This makes sense, since many Gen Ys are supervised by Gen X. You see, it is not just historical influences that define our generational mindsets. We must consider the generation who raised, coached, taught or mentored us. \nConsider this: we have noticed for quite some time the \ndifferences between Baby Boomers and Gen X. Many Millennials\u2019 parents are Baby Boomers. Many of Gen Z\u2019s parents are Gen X. There is bound to be a difference in these two categories simply because of parental influence. Millennials entered the workforce during a time of economic optimism. Baby Boomers told them that finding a job you are passionate about will mean that you will never \u201cwork\u201d a day in your life; hence, the job-hopping tendency. Gen Z has seen the impact of the economic recession on their families. And, being parented by Gen X who has seen more ups and downs in the economy than any other generation, Gen Z realizes that getting a college degree is not a guarantee of career stability. \nUnfortunately, because of the economy, not as many \nentry-level part-time jobs are available to them to gain the experience they seek as were available to the Millennials. Millennials are often described as \u201cdreamers,\u201d while Gen Z are being described as \u201crealists.\u201d One of the biggest differences between \nMillennials  \nand Gen Z  is technology. That might seem like a strange \nstatement to you if you are older than anyone in this post-1980 category. We have a tendency to define them all by their use of technology. But consider this: Millennials are tech savvy. They grew up experiencing huge advances in technology. Gen Z, however, are digital natives. Flip phones are antiques to them. Millennials learned to use notebooks and tablets as those technologies became available to them. As toddlers, Gen Z played with iPads they found lying around the house. For Millennials, technology advanced faster than the guidelines for its use were established. They posted private information on Facebook then later discovered that their employer was monitoring negative postings they had made about the company, creating unforeseen consequences. Gen Z has already heard about these consequences. The cautionary guidelines for use of technology are provided to them at the moment they first gain access to that technology. Their views of privacy are different. Their views of what to share and how to share it are different. Their views of sources of information are different. Millennials find \u201chow-to\u201d instruction on websites. Gen Z prefers instructional YouTube videos.\nInformation about the differences among the post-1980 \npopulation is just now evolving. How can we know for sure what their mindsets will be about their careers when the majority of Gen Z hasn\u2019t entered the full-time workforce yet?\nOne thing is for sure, the world is a much different place than \nwhen most of us grew up. We are only beginning to discover how Gen Z is distinct from Millennials. Yet, it is important to recognize these differences among our younger generations if for no other reason than to decide the best means of communicating with them: email, text, Twitter, Snapchat, etc.  \nBut what is the most important reason to keep up with the \nlatest information about generational mindsets?

Think about that for a moment. Can you remember a time in your career that you knew the person who had the answer to the question you had, but they weren\u2019t very nice; so instead you asked around among the people you liked, hoping they had the answer you needed? I know that I have. As we take a step back and look at the implications of this, how much time/effort/money is wasted because there are miserable individuals in the workplace and no one wants to interact with them? So what do we do? Unfortunately the starting point is not fixing THEM, it\u2019s taking a look at ourselves.\nSo how do you rate? Think back over the past week. Would you \nsay you experienced more negative emotions over positive? Equal negative and positive emotions? Or more positive emotions over negative ones? There is a magic ratio that indicates an individual is flourishing in their lives. Barbara Fredrickson, author of the book Positivity, has done extensive research on the topic and says the ratio is 3:1, three positive emotions to every one negative. If you find that you regularly experience more negative, or equal positive to negative \nemotions you have some work to do. \n\u201cBut that\u2019s \njust the way I am\u201d  you say, \u201cwhy do I \nneed to change?\u201d\nThe following is some compelling evidence as to why being \nhappy is such an advantage at work. Besides the benefits of co-workers wanting to talk and collaborate with you, studies indicate happy workers have higher levels of productivity, produce higher sales, perform better in leadership positions, receive higher performance ratings, receive higher pay, enjoy more job security and are less likely to take sick days, quit or become burned out according to Shawn Achor, author of the book, Happiness Advantage (2010). People who are happy not only experience great benefits on the job, but experience success in every other domain of their lives; socially, emotionally, cognitively and physically. In fact studies show that positive people can actually live up to an average of ten years longer! Yes, ten years!!!!\nThere are several proven ways to increase positive emotions. \nExercise, acts of kindness, meditation, keeping a gratitude journal and focusing on strengths are just some of the ways to help improve mood. Getting enough sleep and eating a healthy diet also play a huge role in how we feel. But more often in my classes, I am asked not how to increase \nhappiness, but how to decrease negativity and reduce stress.\nStress is not all bad. Some stress (good stress) is episodic, \ncan help you get ready for a challenge and GIVES you energy \nto perform at your best. When you are in a state of \u201cflow,\u201d \nyou are experiencing enough stress to challenge you, but not \noverwhelm you. Bad stress however, is chronic, leads to burn \nout and makes you feel exhausted. When you are in a constant \nstate of low to mid-level stress (which a lot of us are most of \nthe time), your body never has a chance to recover. You go and \ngo and go, like the Energizer Bunny until you crash. You may \nget physically sick, become depressed or not even want to get \nout of bed in the morning. Sound familiar?\nStress results from the gap between our expectations (of \nourselves, of others, of the situation) and reality. We often \nthink we can accomplish more than we can and overpromise \nor don\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d. We think we can change our miserable boss, \nco-worker or direct report, and tend to focus on everything \nthey are doing wrong. We have high expectations of how \nwe should be treated, rewarded or compensated by our \norganizations, and are disappointed, frustrated or even angry \nwhen they fall short.

Everyone that you have some type of relationship with \u2013 friends, family, neighbors, boss, co-workers, direct reports, areas of responsibility in our jobs, etc. We may be able to make changes here, but only if we can be influential with those people. Being influential involves developing our listening skills, our empathy for others, avoiding arguments or situations that make others feel inferior. Again, how we act and what we do falls into our \u201ccircle of control,\u201d how others respond to us does not; it falls into our \u201ccircle of influence.\u201d To effect change with others, the only thing you can do is to keep trying different approaches but you can not make others change. At some point you need to quit trying, quit stressing and move on.\nWhat falls into the last circle, the \u201ccircle of concern (or no \ncontrol)\u201d is everything else. Your company downsizes, there is a policy change, you get a new boss, new technology, you are put on a different team or in a new department, etc. The list goes on and on. We spend so much time worrying and stressing about the things we have absolutely no control over, it wastes A LOT of mental energy. You may experience stress or negative emotions when a change happens to you, but the choice is yours. You can either get on board or move on. Of course accepting change does not happen overnight, but again, you can only put your mental energy into what you are doing, your \u201ccircle of control\u201d and make the choice that\u2019s best for you.\nWhen faced with people and situations at work that are \nchallenging and causing you stress, you essentially need to ask yourself three very important questions:\n1. \u201cCan I change the situation?\u201d  If \nthe answer is no, then move on to number two;\n2. \u201cCan I change my thoughts about the situation?\u201d \nIf the answer is no \nthen move onto the third;\n3. \u201cIs it time for a change?\u201d That \nchange may be a new position, department or organization.\nThese questions aren\u2019t easy, but worth a try. I have a personal example of going through these questions. I once had a very challenging boss. I struggled with this person daily and the situation caused me much stress and emotional strain. For the first question, \u201ccan I change the situation?\u201d I came up empty. No, I did not feel as though I could change the situation. I tried talking with this boss but nothing I said seemed to matter and it appeared it was making the situation worse.Moving on to question two, \u201ccan I change my thoughts about the situation?\u201d At first I could. I knew that working for this person was giving me opportunities that I would not have \ngotten working for anyone else, and it was meeting my career \ngoals at that time. I knew that this would be great experience \nfor my future plans. So I managed to change my thoughts for a while, but eventually the stress was back and I had to go to question three, \u201cis it time for a change?\u201d Ultimately I did have \nto change positions and departments. It was a lateral move, \nbut for me, it was what I needed to do. I am not saying that \nany of this is easy, but to reduce the stress and negativity in your life, it may be time to be honest with yourself about the \nsituation.\nFinally, I have one additional set of questions that can help \nyou change your mindset about a negative, stressful situation.

In other words, leaders communicate information about a change that will be occurring the same way they do other general information. Announcements are made by email or the information is shared in a meeting. Rarely are feedback mechanisms in place, messages crafted by audience or sent by the most influential people. I call it \n\u201cvanilla\u201d messaging - very generic and not really impactful or comforting during times of change.\nCommunication is the cornerstone of a change management \nstrategy , and creating and implementing an effective change \ncommunication plan takes a lot of work. To break out of \u201cvanilla\u201d planning and to achieve the desired behavior changes, leaders must handle communications about a change initiative similar to how they would execute an internal marketing campaign. After all, you are \u2018selling the change\u2019 to your employees. Once you make this paradigm shift, pulling together a change communications plan is made easier by following proven principles of good marketing. Too often organizations feel communicating change is just that\u2026telling employees about the change. Marketing firms know that successful selling is all about the emotional hook. Think about the car salesman whose main objective is to get you into the car for a test drive rather than just reviewing a brochure.\nChange Management research has shown over and over that \nyou have to appeal to people\u2019s intellect AND to their emotions to see lasting behavioral change. Communication is a key factor when attempting to appeal to people\u2019s emotions. However, openly talking about people\u2019s emotions is not common in the traditional workplace. It\u2019s uncomfortable and difficult, and emotions are a moving target. In my opinion, this is why organizations have not caught onto the secret of using marketing techniques to sell their change.\nCommunications about a major change initiative start long \nbefore a formal communications plan is complete and the messages are carefully crafted. In fact, they may have been happening for months before the project kicks off. Communication about change always begins when the rumors about the change start. Nothing is more emotionally charged than a rumor. That\u2019s why rumors spread so fast. Oftentimes, employees revel in continuing to enhance the rumor and love being in the know.So let\u2019s take a page from the marketing book and look at how \nour marketing counterparts \u2018launch\u2019 a product. They start \nthe rumors themselves with \u2018teaser campaigns.\u2019 A teaser \nad reveals only a little about the product. Its purpose is to \narouse widespread attention, and build excitement and \nexpectations through consumer curiosity. Let\u2019s use an example of a current, common organizational change: rolling out Office 365. You could use a slogan \u2018Coming in December, a better \nway to manage your time\u2019 on banners, posters, videos etc., \nand then change slogans periodically until you can start a \ncommunications plan in earnest.\nNow that you have launched your teaser campaign, the next \nstep is to gather the information you need to create effective \nmessages:\n1. What\u2019s changing?\n2. When is the change happening?\n3. What\u2019s the change impact?\n4. Why should employees change?\nWhat\u2019s changing? Describe the new \n\u2018product\u2019:  It\u2019s important to make the definition of the \nchange easy to understand, easy to remember and short. Remove all technical jargon.\n\u2022 Office 365 is a Microsoft email and social networking software.\nWhen is the change happening? Timeline: \nDon\u2019t give a specific date early in the project. Dates change and it can jeopardize the credibility of the project team. Once the date is solidified, be more specific.\n\u2022 You will begin using Office 365 in Q4 of 2016.\n 330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        20  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "17f4bc14-5df4-49f2-8b97-46848fba03df", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "03f21db77883750a47021c096423d7332242e195c80b6ca9ffa7900082df7c6a", "extra_info": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3965, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "1022b7bf-7ac8-4077-9a8f-d17093accfb3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "215a4aad-2e42-45b7-beaf-7f99501527a1": {"__data__": {"text": "What\u2019s the change impact? Your audience: \nDoing your homework is extremely important when \ndetermining the change impact. Your efforts here will drive the quality and success of your communication efforts. For example, let\u2019s say I work for Nike. When selling new basketball shoes, I use LeBron as my spokesperson for TV, print and social media advertising to male audiences ranging in age from 12 to 25. I repeat these ads with the message \u2018These shoes will improve your basketball performance.\u2019\nIn this case I knew who my audience was, the best way to send \nthe messages and the most influential spokesperson to send the messages.\nNow, let\u2019s look at this scenario from an organizational change \nperspective. The spokespeople for Office 365 will have to be the company\u2019s leaders. Executive leadership sends a strategic message \u2018Changing to Office 365 modernizes our administrative efforts, improving efficiencies and ultimately keeping us competitive. It offers enhanced features that help you manage your email more efficiently. For the first time, we will have secure social media opportunities.\u2019 Middle managers send tactical messages. For instance, telling employees when to go to training and encouraging the use of Office 365. Messages from the project manager, change manager, HR etc. will not be as effective.\nIf the audience is global, providing messages in appropriate \nlanguages shows respect and special effort. Websites, social media, video conferencing and printed speaking points are some of the best vehicles to reach global audiences. Use different tactics for smaller audiences less geographically dispersed. In either case, make sure to repeat messages seven to 12 times; which research has shown is best practice for message retention.\nWhy should employees change? Emotional hook: \nNow it\u2019s time to bring emotions back into the picture \nand encourage action. One-size fits all messaging won\u2019t be effective in this situation. For each audience, prepare a message that explains how the change will impact them and what benefits they will realize for embracing the change. For marketing examples, emotional advertising is all around us. Budweiser draft horses just make you smile. Speaking of smiling, share a Coca Cola. Speaking of Coke, messages don\u2019t get any more personal than having your own name on a can of pop.\nDon\u2019t think organizational change can be this emotional? \nTry messing with someone\u2019s email and you will see emotion. Office 365 may sound pretty benign, but it also changes how calendars will be managed, how conference rooms will be reserved and how many people can be sent an email at once. Who will be the most impacted? Administrative Assistants will be impacted more and differently than a staff employee who only uses email functions. Emotions will run higher with the former group and the benefits will be different for the latter. It\u2019s important to be transparent with change impacts, both positive and negative. This honesty builds trust in the messages. Either way it is important to talk to the benefits each group will realize. Describe how pain points will be alleviated and efficiencies gained.\nStay in contact with your audiences. They may be on-board \nwith the change today, but if they don\u2019t hear something on a \nregular basis you will lose momentum. People fill in the gaps \nwith poor communications. Unfortunately, humans are a \nfearful bunch and the gaps are rarely filled in with optimism. In the end, it\u2019s about encouragement and trust built through all your change management efforts including communications.\nAs a parting thought, don\u2019t forget marketing\u2019s best tactic, i.e. \nfree stuff. Messages can be placed on, in, around promotional items. Giveaways are always well received. They are an attention grabber and generally make people smile, which is always good during times of change. It never ceases to amaze me the lengths people will go for a bottle of hand sanitizer with a silly cap.\n WWW.KENT.EDU/YOURTRAININGPARTNER         21  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "215a4aad-2e42-45b7-beaf-7f99501527a1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5096e9ae2e183e2898666647e556c518280d6519efbb17bee71cd8c5e8f018fb", "extra_info": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4022, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "c2c78cac-5ca1-4843-9366-a555531e46f4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7596053f-04dd-4822-963e-49902effb49d": {"__data__": {"text": "CREATING A \nCOMMUNICATION CALENDAR\nWritten By: Kent State Facilitator Tim Kraft\nThere are few things in business \nthat aren\u2019t done based on a plan. \nFor anything related to spending, \nthere are budgets. When it comes to employees, there are performance plans. Any significant undertaking is \nbased on a project plan.\nWhat\u2019s surprising is how few \norganizations create an employee communications plan. Despite \nthe fact that almost everyone \nagrees good communication is \nessential to engaging and motivating employees, there\u2019s \nseldom any thought given to the content, format or timing of those communications. Instead it\u2019s a largely ad hoc and uncoordinated effort that isn\u2019t nearly as effective as it could be.What\u2019s needed is a communication calendar that will ensure your employees are kept well informed, not just on the routine and ad hoc information, but more importantly on the bigger topics related to your organization and its success.MORE PLANNING, NOT MORE COMMUNICATING\nCreating a communication calendar seldom means adding more communication events. Rather it\u2019s a matter of thinking about the \nevents you already do in a more coordinated way. Consider for a minute how many formal communication interactions you already have with employees. Do you have routine team or project meetings? Performance review meetings? Lunch and learns? Sales team meetings? No doubt, you have some or all of them. They become the framework of your calendar.\nWith the events identified, start plugging in the high-level \ncontent. Your plan can include standing topics, the things discussed in every meeting, if you like. Doing so creates a precursor to your actual meeting agendas. (You DO have an agenda for each meeting, right?) What\u2019s more important to include, though, are the larger themes or topics you want to present to your team in a thoughtful, coordinated way. These are the topics that will engage employees and help them feel more in sync with your organization.\nWhat kind of topics or themes might provide grist for your \ncommunication calendar? The list is long.\n\u2022 Organizational Performance: Employees \nfeel more engaged when they are kept in the loop about how your organization is doing. What metrics are of the greatest interest to employees? Identify one metric per month to share with employees in depth. Be sure to include an explanation of the employees\u2019 role in improving those metrics.\n\u2022 Personal Development:  What skills or behaviors \ndo you want to encourage in your employees? Teamwork? Innovation? Safety? Select one per quarter to discuss with them. Share ways to build or improve those behaviors, and recognize employees who successfully model them.\n\u2022 Financial Results: Employees like to know how well \ntheir business is succeeding in the market, but for many of them the financial results are just numbers. They don\u2019t really understand the significance of your inventory or cost of goods sold. Pick one aspect of your financials per quarter and educate employees about it. Again, include an explanation of what they can do to move those financials in the desired direction.\n 330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        22  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "7596053f-04dd-4822-963e-49902effb49d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1bd530951fccb2a3553ca65faee134221ff0f6cb3686032295b2f8c8ea47e7fb", "extra_info": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3192, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "dfc8972c-6563-4935-8376-e396f2d07bad"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d86a728-dbf0-4ee4-a2c9-acf72a7804de": {"__data__": {"text": "\u2022 Corporate Culture: You, no doubt, have a clear \npicture of your corporate culture. You know what the \ncompany aspires to be and the image you want to project to your customers, community members and suppliers. Do your employees know those things? That would be a great conversation to have. Why not plan to do it?\nPLAN TO PLAN\nMost leaders are so caught up in their day-to-day activities that creating a communication calendar is something that falls to the bottom of the to-do pile. Don\u2019t let that happen. If \nyou believe in the power of communication to engage and motivate employees, then the half hour it will take to create a communication calendar could be the most important thing you do today.\nSet aside the time to give some thought to what would be \nbeneficial to share with your employees over the course of the year. Most people do too little of this kind of big-picture thinking. Don\u2019t be surprised that the act of thinking about what you want to communicate with employees forces you to clarify for yourself what\u2019s useful or important to your organization. Over and over, when working on a communication plan with my clients, the simple act of discussing their communication goals provides them with valuable insights. Developing a communication plan is a valuable exercise on several levels. ACT ON THE PLAN\nOnce your calendar is created, be sure it doesn\u2019t end up buried in a folder, never again to see the light of day. As the year progresses, rely on the calendar to remind you about the \nthings you identified as being important discussion topics.\nWhat format should your calendar take? That doesn\u2019t matter \none bit. Use whatever tool is convenient for you to capture the information. It could be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet that shows the communication event (team meeting, for example), the timing (Week 1, Week 2 or January, February, etc.) and the topic(s) to discuss in each event. \nCreating a communication calendar takes only a small bit \nof planning to create and a moment or two each week to refer to and identify upcoming topics. The payoff for this small investment of time can be huge. Sharing higher-level topics and themes with employees in a planned, coordinated communication effort is guaranteed to help them feel more informed and engaged in your organization. That will pay off in providing a clearer vision of their role in your organization\u2019s success, and increase the likelihood that they can and will fulfill that role to the best of their abilities. \n WWW.KENT.EDU/YOURTRAININGPARTNER         23  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "7d86a728-dbf0-4ee4-a2c9-acf72a7804de", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1f6ef90337af8e5abf9f68df23b39f485a7c46083e2ac4a95f8ba2ef2678e004", "extra_info": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2573, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "fe29f94d-8742-4e52-8c69-811ad2879283"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3b6c56f-2735-4a5b-8440-4e77684555f9": {"__data__": {"text": "WHY CHANGE MANAGEMENT?\nWritten By: Kent State Facilitator Jessica Thomas\nCHANGE MANAGEMENT IS MORE \nIMPORTANT THAN EVER TO ENSURE PROJECT SUCCESS\n.\nFifteen years ago twenty-five percent of major business change initiatives impacted less than fifty people and cost less than $100,000. Today, that same twenty-five percent impacts more than 5,000 people and costs more than $10M. This is a one hundred times increase in fifteen years! This growth has been driven by globalization and an increase in technology projects. That means projects have become one hundred times riskier. Few companies can afford a $10M loss if a change project fails. The number one reason projects fail is employee resistance to change. If this seems improbable, ask yourself what percent of the success of your current projects is based on employees changing their behavior? When I ask that question to my clients I often get the answer 90 to 100 percent. If that is the case, what percentage of your budget are you dedicating to support that change in behavior?\nInvesting in proven project management strategies and \nstructures that monitor project timelines, scope and cost is critical to success. However, delivering a project on time, within scope and budget doesn\u2019t guarantee success. Your employees have to embrace and adopt the new systems or processes. Change management is a structured methodology whose purpose is to engage employees in the change. It complements the formal project management efforts. Ideally, the project plans combine project management tasks along with change management tasks so they both can be budgeted, tracked and delivered. \nCHANGE MANAGEMENT IS SO MUCH MORE THAN TRAINING AND COMMUNICATIONS.\nTypically, organizations believe change management consists only of training and communications efforts and those activities are usually part of the budget. While employees have to have the knowledge of the new systems or processes to be able to perform in the \u2018new\u2019 company environment, it\u2019s rarely enough to get employees engaged. For example, my teenage daughter knows how to use our brand new dishwasher. That doesn\u2019t mean she is motivated to load it with dishes and turn it on. However, when employees are asked why they are not adopting the new desired behaviors, their answer undoubtedly will be: \u201cI wasn\u2019t trained.\u201d Don\u2019t confuse their opinion about the quality of the training they received and their level of proficiency. Proficiency comes when people push through their low level of comfort using the knowledge they gained in training.\nCommunications becomes the tool by which companies \n\u2018tell people\u2019 to push through that low level of comfort. So employees are told or asked to perform the new desired behaviors. Let\u2019s see how that worked for me. I asked my teenage daughter to load the dirty dishes into the new dishwasher. She said she would, but then she didn\u2019t. I asked her again, and again she failed to complete the task. Then, I told her to do it, no more Mrs. Nice. She grudgingly did what I told her to do, but then I had to keep \u2018telling\u2019 her time and time again to regularly get clean dishes. I had training and communications in my \u2018new dishwasher\u2019 plan, but it continued to be difficult to have clean dishes.\nI understand that this example is oversimplified; however this \nprocess and result are very common in business situations as well. Leaders feel that \u2018telling\u2019 their employees what to do is sufficient to get them on-board. This is partly true. The key is how to relay the message, the content of the message and who sends it. These considerations are part of a structured change management plan.\u2003\nLEADERSHIP COACHING IS ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT.\nThe interesting thing is, while having a structured change management approach is important to engage employees in the change, the most important part of that approach is leadership coaching \u2013 not training or communications.

This isn\u2019t difficult for leaders. It doesn\u2019t take a huge time commitment just to be visible. Employees can only get behind leaders they recognize. In fact, sponsors need to treat their change efforts as leading a campaign sending meaningful messages to rally the crowd.

They will be the people who require their team to attend training and who will reinforce new behaviors.\nIronically, mid-level managers tend to be the most resistant to \nthe change. They are absolutely key to employee engagement, yet are the most difficult to get to buy-in. Your change management plan needs to recognize this and have special tactics to address their resistance. Reward and recognize early adopters, give them the additional resources they need to work through the productivity dip. Develop resistance and sustainment plans with them.

The project director insisted the change management plan was integrated with the overall project plan. The sponsors were active and visible throughout the entire project even after installing the new system. They constantly communicated directly with employees.

Today\u2019s society values brevity. \nPeople send short but frequent text messages to update others \non their whereabouts and happenings. Few people listen to an entire State of the Union Address, but instead prefer to be informed later by the summary sound bites provided \nby the news media. This is not a new phenomenon created \nby technology, however. Back in the day this preference for \nconcise communication was referred to as \u201cGive me the Reader\u2019s Digest condensed version.\u201d You see, not everyone has patient listening skills. If they did, then interruptions would not \nbe such a common occurrence in conversations.\nPeople who have this tendency to provide more detail than \nlisteners require are talking in the manner in which they think. Their process is very much a problem-solution pattern of thinking: describe the history of the topic so that people understand how the current situation evolved, discuss the problem and how it affects people, provide insight as to the potential causes of each one of these problems, brainstorm possible solutions, eliminate solutions one-by-one by providing reasons why these solutions are not viable and then reveal the solution considered to be the best option. And, if there is time, the implementation of this solution is listed in step-by-step detailed instructions so that error can be eliminated, thereby ensuring that the chosen solution really is best. Considering the run-on sentence I just wrote, it is probably no surprise that I also can have detail-oriented tendencies.\nFor many of us, the reason for providing all of this detail is to \nconvince others that our idea has credibility. The proposed idea is thoroughly evaluated as to remove any margin of error. Detail may also be offered due to a fear of not being able to hold our own during a debate. The thinking is that if all detail has been presented in a methodical way with all aspects of the \ntopic already considered, no debate should be necessary.\nUnfortunately this detail-orientation can interfere with the \nvery influence we are trying to achieve. Our credibility can be adversely affected in several ways:\n1. People stop asking for our opinion  because \nthey do not have either the time to wait for us to analyze the problem or the patience to listen to the long, drawn-out answer. Result: Our expertise is not being utilized.2. We have \u201cburied the lead,\u201d  meaning that the \nsolution is surrounded by so much other information that its magnitude has been diminished. Result: Our solutions are not adopted.\n3. Our reputations for perfectionism can \nlead people to conclude that we are difficult to please. Result: The perception that we are not cooperative project partners.\nThis third point requires some additional thought: Perfectionism requires a focus on detail; without detail how can anything be accomplished perfectly? It can be difficult to work with someone who has such a clear picture of how a task should be performed and so little tolerance for those procedures not being followed. Often the perfectionist is left to complete the task alone because others are simply tired of being corrected. Maybe this solitude was the goal. But, going it alone does not make us a good team player, now does it?There is another critical reputation factor that can adversely be affected by perfectionism: accountability. Think of how many times you may have avoided starting a project until all of the details had been considered. The mind-set is: \u201cDon\u2019t do anything until you are certain of the outcome.\u201d Fear of being wrong is a strong motivational force for detail-oriented people. It is often why we cannot speak up as quickly as we would like, resulting in many missed opportunities for our creativity to be acknowledged.\nThere are several ways to improve detail-orientation and its \ncredibility-diminishing", "doc_id": "6dcf2787-2e7f-45f9-a8ee-bf4e7444e1f0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "95453804aa7f43b2f044a3dba6d4d32cd4403ced3b7db43457e6662089aad970", "extra_info": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4053, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "30c64a89-651c-4c16-b58d-fbaac74bef2f", "3": "21d65f62-b098-4240-900c-b3e2cf73f46e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "21d65f62-b098-4240-900c-b3e2cf73f46e": {"__data__": {"text": "are several ways to improve detail-orientation and its \ncredibility-diminishing effects in communication:\n1.

For example: Answering the question, \u201cDo you want cream in your coffee?\u201d is not a high priority issue and therefore does not require a dissertation on one\u2019s history with lactose intolerance.\n2. Sync your inner clock with others. In a \nmeeting, are your colleagues ready to vote? Be careful of choosing this moment to finally state your objections. Bad timing creates the reputation for being negative. During the discussion of ideas, simply state that you have reservations but haven\u2019t thought it through completely.

Even if you say: \u201cI have several ideas but haven\u2019t sorted them all out yet,\u201d you are providing important understanding.\n4. Resist the urge to tell the entire story.  Are \nyou one of those customers who call with a question about payment on your account, but cannot resist the urge to tell a long story about why you needed to buy the product in the first place? Customer service reps are trained to listen patiently, but they may also have a timer determining the efficiency with which they handle each call. Your detail may be affecting their job performance review.\n5. Give the moral before telling the story. \nLearn to put your conclusion first and then determine how much explanation is necessary to describe the idea or prove your point. Notice how these bullet points are arranged. The point first; explanation after.\nWhat if you are not a detail-oriented person, but are trying to communicate with one? First remember: people talk in the manner in which they think. Perhaps you pride yourself on being able to make quick decisions. You are probably the person people turn to in a crisis. But in other situations that are not at crisis level, your quick decision-making can be perceived by the detail-oriented person to be impulsive. In the words of my detail-oriented father: \u201cHe just slapped that idea together.\u201d Therefore, if you are trying to interact effectively with a detail-oriented person and to blend your desire for timely and concise information with their need for completeness, consider following these steps:\n1. Talk in detail.  If you make a brief statement and walk \naway expecting that statement to have been accepted\u2026wrong! What you have just done is to send the detailer into research mode. They will be there for days looking for the information that will prove to you that you rushed to judgment.\n2. Stop talking while they think.  If in an attempt \nto get them to decide more quickly you keep saying: \u201cThink about this\u2026\u201d you have just given them more detail to consider and added significant time to their decision-making process.3. Tell them how much you trust their judgment.\n Since detail is used to prove the credibility \nof their point, reinforce your belief in their expertise often. Then begin to negotiate how much detail they need to present to you. Tell them that even when they are \u201ctalking off of the top of their heads,\u201d you believe their ideas are much more thoughtful than most people\u2019s.\n4. Try not to interrupt.  Interrupting to move them \nahead in the discussion will be counterproductive. They will either shut down and then send you a twelve-page email later (you cannot interrupt them in an email) or start over again. The thought process is that you interrupted because you do not understand. Therefore, they need to go back and provide more detail the second time to help you catch up. If you do ever need to interrupt them, do so with a detailed paraphrase of their point. Do not simply say: \u201cYes I get what you mean, so what\u2019s your conclusion?\u201d State your understanding of their point in detail. (See Bullet Point #1)\n5. Resist the urge to provide too many templates for talking points. \nI have seen many \nmanagers who have provided templates for their detail-oriented people to use when writing emails or making presentations. This can help the detailer understand what points the manager deems relevant. However, it may also discourage the detailer from providing additional data when the situation warrants it. This is, after-all, a person who is a stickler for the rules.

Everyone agrees it is \ntime to stop talking about it and finally implement a solution. Yet, every time a solution is presented to decision-makers, the idea is met with resistance and no action is taken. Once this situation has happened a number of times, people who were creative thinkers and enthusiastic problem-solvers have now become complacent and silent. People often say, \u201cWhy bother trying? No matter how great the idea, the answer will be \u2018no\u2019 anyway. They keep saying they want logic, not magic. What does that mean?\u201d\nDoes this situation sound familiar in your workplace? Perhaps \nyou have become one of those who have given up trying to present new ideas because you believe nothing you say matters. If only magic words really did exist that would convince others to our way of thinking \u2013 words that speak the truth so clearly that no one could possibly possess an opposing view or act in opposition to our call for action. Unfortunately, these magic words do not exist\u2026with the obvious exception of the words \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d that our mothers told us are quite powerful. But, how many times have you become frustrated that your logical idea was not adopted and incredulous that the idea was actually questioned and debated? After all, the idea is pure common sense that anyone should understand, right?\nTherein lies the problem: what exactly is logical, common \nsense? I have heard many people assert that the instructions they gave someone were \u201csimply good common sense steps,\u201d but then became confused when no one followed those instructions. People solve problems by different methods, possess different knowledge, perceive the world in different ways and have different priorities. Why then do we expect people to accept an idea simply because it makes sense to us? How often are we guilty of imposing our will on others without thinking about why this would be a logical course of action from their point of view?\nPeople are adamant about what they believe to be simple, \neasy-to-accept common sense concepts. Showing passionate commitment to an idea can be very persuasive. However, if the idea itself is not relevant to the listener\u2019s situation or is not presented in an understandable way, the idea will be dismissed no matter how passionately it was presented. In fact, the more a listener knows about a subject, the less likely that person will be influenced by emotional appeal or charisma.\nThe first and most important guideline for presenting a \npersuasive business case , therefore, is to define the \ntopic from the decision-maker\u2019s point of view. What do they need to hear to be persuaded? An example \nof the importance of this strategy happened several years \nago in a presentation skills course I was teaching at Kent \nState University. The student\u2019s topic choice was to convince \nus that Richard Nixon was a good president. Unfortunately, the presenter failed to define the factors that make a \u201cgood president\u201d from her audience\u2019s point of view. Instead of talking about leadership decisions that impacted the country in a positive way, for example, she used the following argument to convince us, \u201cWhen Nixon was in China, he arranged to have panda bears brought back to zoos in the U.S.\u201d Jaws dropped in simultaneous disbelief throughout the room. Procuring pandas makes someone a good president?\nNow consider your target audience or decision-maker. If this \nperson is only concerned with budget, talk about how your idea affects the budget. If you start your presentation by talking about how your idea affects customer service, it may be a valid point, but it will be ignored because of the budgetary concern. You must \u201csell\u201d your ideas based on your \u201cbuyer\u2019s\u201d needs.

If you are presenting to high-level managers, \nthey must make decisions based on a high level view of the \norganization, not just on how the problem affects you and \nyour group. How does your idea affect other departments or company goals? What would persuade the board of directors if your decision-maker were to present your idea to them? In \norder to be persuasive, it is imperative to go beyond how the \ntopic affects us. If our focus is only on what we believe to be \nimportant or how we are affected by the problem, we could be perceived as nothing but whiners whose proposal is not critical to consider. \n 330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        30  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "7d9e7e5d-ed56-453a-910a-37c76ef83887", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f3e49969f62dbd78e371a7c3b73ccec2944768c059a723932ecb255ea5584503", "extra_info": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3835, "end": 5154, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d0e4a81b-3259-4982-a6ec-a3e164740ac2", "2": "f60bb7f5-0759-45ad-8391-0947ab70c2e9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb1daa0c-38fb-4590-a39f-4b8da7cf2357": {"__data__": {"text": "Do you want to be a complainer or a convincer? Remember: \nhumans are constantly asking themselves \u201cHow does this idea affect me?\u201d To be persuasive you must provide the answer to that question for them.\nBut, what if their primary concern is a negative aspect of \nyour business case? When a strong objection is universally known, you must acknowledge its existence and address it early in your remarks. Hopefully, you will be able to refute the objection with new information the listener has not heard before. No one is convinced by the same information they have already considered. Give your listeners a new perspective on the topic. At the very least, present old information in a new way.\nIf you fail to acknowledge a universally known objection, \nyou may be interrupted and challenged before you even have a chance to offer positive attributes of the idea. In the student\u2019s \u201cNixon and Pandas\u201d presentation, she failed to even mention Watergate. Question-answer session was completely consumed by discussion of this issue and any persuasive arguments she had made were lost in the melee. In her situation, however, refuting Watergate was not an option. What could she say, \u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal?\u201d No, but the strategy would have been to acknowledge Watergate and agree with listeners about its negative affect on the country. The next step would have been to ask the audience to put the objection aside for ten minutes while other points were presented. The negatives and positives of the subject could then be weighed during a group discussion after all other information was revealed. Of course it is possible that listeners would maintain their objection that Watergate was too negative for them to view Nixon\u2019s presidency as a positive, but she would have had the opportunity to offer other arguments in that ten minutes. Sometimes the goal of a persuasive message is to open listener\u2019s minds to another point of view. Listeners may then be willing to schedule a follow-up presentation in which a call for action to support and implement the solution could be proposed. Trying to accomplish too much before decision-makers are ready to even listen to the idea can result in a \u201cno\u201d answer.\nIf your goal is to achieve commitment for implementation of \nyour idea, then make it easy for action to occur. Keep them focused on doing, not deciding. What can be done today to start the process in an easy-to-accomplish step? Take the stairs instead of the elevator. You are on your way to a 10,000 steps per day goal. Perhaps the decision-maker has an aversion for risk-taking. The business case should include information on how to minimize the risk, examples of when similar risks were taken with successful outcomes in the past and a simple starting point plan. Suggest reviewing the success of each implemented step before embarking on the next step. This way decisions are being made about small steps, not huge, devastating-if-it-fails initiatives. Remove fear of taking action.\nPreparing the content of your proposal to create connection \nwith your listeners is critical to being persuasive. However, smooth, confident delivery of the message is also important to your business case being accepted. Too many PowerPoint slides will detract from your ability to look people directly in the eye and demonstrate your commitment to the proposal. Presenting too much background detail or extraneous data will not only confuse the decision-maker, but will also surround your strongest arguments with \u201cnoise.\u201d Avoid technical jargon. Know your audience. Terminology used by chemical engineers may be unfamiliar to electrical engineers simply for lack of daily use of the word. Be descriptive, but not wordy. Often presenters know their information, but are unfamiliar with the order in which they want to present this information causing awkward pauses. Practice. View questions as opportunities to adapt your message to the immediate needs of your listeners, not attacks or interruptions. Believe in yourself and your ideas.

This is what is meant by \u201clogic, not magic.\u201d It makes sense to me!\n WWW.KENT.EDU/YOURTRAININGPARTNER         31  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "6dc32448-ebef-42b5-830c-cbe2beb66ccc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3533e8572c6df791c7837ed0d2345d7e694764cdf49bc55b4e7c5388a2412bb8", "extra_info": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 4076, "end": 4720, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "93d0c216-4104-4ccf-86e8-aa8408f6c8b1", "2": "fb1daa0c-38fb-4590-a39f-4b8da7cf2357"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "89078568-2730-45eb-a460-a8bdff57d9a6": {"__data__": {"text": "TECHNICAL \u2260 DULL\nWritten By: Kent State Facilitator Deborah Easton\nOften when presenting technical information, people believe \nthat some topics are just inherently dull and nothing can be done to change that fact. This belief is not fact. Detail can be presented in a way that motivates people to listen because the relevance of this detail is made clear to them. Statistics can be described so that people can picture their significance and magnitude. Processes can be described in ways that make the information easy to follow. A good example of these adaptations is the methods that many science teachers use to make science fun. In fact, if you Google the words \u201cmake science fun,\u201d you will find numerous TED talks and YouTube videos demonstrating various techniques for turning complex scientific principles into interesting and understandable concepts.\nSo, why is it then that people continue to show an infinite \nnumber of PowerPoint slides filled with so much technical data that you can\u2019t even see any one statistic clearly? Most often the presenter is concerned that \u201cdumbing down\u201d technical information will insult the listener\u2019s intelligence or diminish the importance of the topic itself. They fail to realize that listeners will not agree to any idea that they cannot visualize clearly. How comfortable would you be if someone tried to convince you to walk into an unfamiliar room in complete darkness? Also, people can\u2019t implement a process they don\u2019t understand. There is a difference in being condescending (\u201cdumbing it down\u201d) toward listeners and adapting the message to their level of experience with the topic. Condescension is created by remarks like, \u201cYou won\u2019t understand this anyway, so trust me on this.\u201d Adaptation is accomplished by utilizing clear and descriptive examples \nrelating to listeners\u2019 experiences.\nFrequently it is the presenter\u2019s expertise that can be the \nproblem in adapting the message. Certainly pat yourself on the back for what you know and what you have accomplished! \nUnderstand, however, that the most difficult subject to teach \nsomeone else is a subject you no longer remember learning. \nThat subject has become instinctive knowledge. Have you \never taught a child how to tie shoes? You must first remember \nwhat the steps are, then find a way to help the child follow \nthose steps (bunny ears for example). The problem is that \nwe have failed to consider the lack of dexterity in those tiny \nhands, making following the instructions difficult for them and \nfrustrating for us. Perhaps improving dexterity would be the \nbest first step. Then we can talk about tying shoelaces.\nTherefore, the most important adaptation to make is to start \nat the level of your listeners\u2019 experience. This does not mean \nproviding detailed background or historical information to help \nthem catch up. Instead, think about why this topic should be \nof interest to people. How does this subject affect them? Your \nfirst step should be to motivate them to listen by showing a \ndirect connection between them and the topic. Taking the time \nto establish this motivation may mean that you don\u2019t have time \nto go into great detail about the subject. Good! Your goal is to \ncreate a clear new picture of this subject in the minds of these \nlisteners, not to create the same detailed picture filled with \nnuances that you have in your head. Information overload does \nnot teach; it only confuses.\n 330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        32  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "89078568-2730-45eb-a460-a8bdff57d9a6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1f9945d955e68aeca99881ac4f9cb4b48028d5b0d5bd0f24f0f7d53e14e100ef", "extra_info": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3514, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "646af7f7-6fe0-4a8b-a8bc-57994e13f2de"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9adeeaf-d105-4846-b35a-f4a94c995680": {"__data__": {"text": "Secondly, be sure your word choice is understandable. Have \nyou ever witnessed a presentation in which the speaker knew that the audience would not understand technical jargon, but used it anyway? Or perhaps worse yet, a handout of technical terms was distributed, expecting that you would have enough time to find the term on the paper, interpret its meaning and not miss anything else that was said after the word was used. Vocabulary only impresses people if they picture its meaning. Listeners aren\u2019t impressed if word choice requires too much effort to comprehend.\nThe same advice applies to utilizing unfamiliar symbols or \nformulas. If you are the only one who will recognize the symbol for an element on the Periodic Table, then use its common name like iron or aluminum instead of Fe or Al. When listeners struggle with understanding, they tune out!\nStatistics are another element of \ntechnical \npresentations  that require some creativity so that their \nsignificance can be visualized. And, no, sorry, bar graphs and \npie charts don\u2019t always help. For example, you are leading a safety meeting and are giving statistics about how many people have hearing loss because of a failure to wear hearing protection. The statistic states that 1 out of every 3 people will suffer from hearing loss. To avoid the that\u2019s- people-somewhere-else excuse, state: \u201cThere are 24 people in the room and that means 8 of us will have hearing loss.\u201d Make the statistic have personal impact. If the numbers are in a technical formula, use an analogy to something familiar to everyone. Let\u2019s say you have been computing the time your team loses every week by having to correct mistakes or engage in do-overs. Instead of merely showing the numbers and the computation, tell them that the amount of time wasted could be spent playing an 18-hole round of golf. And then perhaps, if they improve efficiency, take them out for an 18-hole round of golf!\nPerhaps the most important advice to enliven a dry, technical \nsubject is to personalize the message. Tell people about \nyour \n\u201caha\u201d moments in working on the project for \nexample. These comments break up the monotony of a list \nof facts presented on endless slides. This technique allows you to be your conversational self, not a monotone robot.

I say \u201cWhy not?\u201d People remember stories better than a series of facts and figures. I remember a history professor who almost defied us to learn. He would talk as fast as he could, presenting very detailed information that was not in the textbook, and would not allow recording of his lecture. What was his purpose as a presenter if we didn\u2019t grasp anything he was saying? We had to guess which aspect of the topic he believed was important because all of the information ran together. We were never certain if the research we had done on our own would be the right information to pass his tests. However, early in the semester he had an unfortunate health problem and a substitute teacher was brought in. The substitute walked into class that first night, looked at the detailed syllabus and outline of topics we were to research, threw that handout on the desk, sat down on the edge of that desk and said: \u201cLet me tell you a story about the French Revolution.\u201d For the next hour and a half all attention was on him. We were enthralled! And we were motivated to research the topic further. But now we were researching because of interest, not because we feared failing the class. He made a litany of names and dates and conflicts come to life. I still remember much of that information, even though it\u2019s been a few (that was sarcasm) years since I heard that presentation.\nThere are many ways a technical topic can be made \ninteresting.

Both forms of communication are beneficial to you as you prepare, deliver and improve upon your presentation style.\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about you, the presenter.\nBE AWARE OF YOUR NONVERBAL \nBEHAVIOR AS A PRESENTER\nThe most powerful nonverbal cues that you can give to your audience are these:\n\u2022 Walk with confidence.  Have good posture. Stand \ntall. Walk confidently to the presentation area.\n\u2022 Engage in direct eye contact.  Look into the eyes \nof your audience. Don\u2019t look at the walls, floor or ceiling. Definitely do not read your notes to the audience. That will disconnect you from the audience.\n\u2022 Use hand gestures to reinforce your message.\n This is an important one. When using hand \ngestures, make sure they look natural. When they are natural, you appear to be authentic, genuine and real. I have seen speakers over-rehearse their hand gestures. It sounds silly, doesn\u2019t it? Yet it happens to be true. Over-rehearsing gestures creates a speaker who is artificial and robotic. Gestures, when they come from the heart, are interpreted as being true and honest. With that said, be careful of a few things: Don\u2019t over-exaggerate. If the fish was just this big, then don\u2019t say it was THIS BIG! Don\u2019t use repeated gestures because they can distract the audience from your message. An example: If you have a tendency to \u201croll\u201d your right hand \nwhen you are talking, then you don\u2019t want to continue \nrolling and rolling and rolling. Pretty soon, the audience \nlooks at your rolling hand gesture and doesn\u2019t listen to your \nmessage.\n\u2022 Move a little.  Movement is good for presenters. Too \nmuch movement is distracting. If you walk from the front of the room to the back of the room, that\u2019s fine. If you move all around the entire room during your entire presentation, your audience will get tired of adjusting their necks or their chairs. A little movement is fine. Avoid repetitive movement. An example: Pacing. When you begin to pace, it creates a rhythm that has an almost hypnotic effect. Think of your pacing body as a pendulum, \u201cyou\u2019re getting sleepy, very sleepy.\u201d Before you know it, your audience will be anticipating your next pivot or turn to return to the other side of the room rather than listening to your message. Robotic pacing is a death knell to any presenter.\n\u2022 Express yourself! With more than 100 muscles in \nyour face alone, you have the amazing capacity to share six primary emotions (fear, joy, love, sadness, surprise and anger) and more than 60 emotional expressions. All of that power comes from less than one square foot of space! What are you doing with it? If you are sharing declining numbers, show it. If you are delighted that you exceeded year-end quotas, show it. If you are sharing a sad story, show it. Your facial expressions reinforce your message. Just make sure that they are not in conflict with your message. If you say, \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be here today to deliver this presentation\u201d and your face shows no emotion, your audience will believe your face.

It speaks volumes about who you are as a person and about your level of professionalism. Take a long, hard look at your professional attire. Are you wearing the same suits that you have been wearing since the 1980s? If so, throw them out! Nobody wants to see someone with larger-than-life padded shoulders (just think of the suits that David Byrne of the rock group The Talking Heads wore in the 1980s). Look at the colors you wear. You want to look current, not dated.\nA few years ago, I was asked to coach a man on his \nprofessional style. The moment he walked into the room, my first impression was set. After we chatted a while, I shared with him those initial thoughts. You see, he was a \u201cmousy\u201d man and everything about him was \u201cmousy.\u201d He wore glasses, a light beige pullover sweater, a light beige shirt and brown pants.    \n 330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        34  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "95a11610-c414-4973-b524-14af91d04afe", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a80d8b74b1955412c709db23495dab1a7254ceafa6ab5a44de6219af041b4422", "extra_info": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 3607, "end": 4720, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "7f2d6547-2f90-4372-8e0c-cf539d15da2b", "2": "174eab15-a33d-4542-90af-b7daf22a39b9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "351c34fc-95c7-4630-8e6b-b84b7961ab17": {"__data__": {"text": "His communication style was on the quiet, shy side. \nNothing about him stood out or communicated power.

Effective pausing, or \nsilence, is one of the most powerful nonverbal cues that you can use while presenting. Yet, most Americans are accustomed to filling every second with sound. Within a presentation, there are certain portions that you want to emphasize. Let silence help you. You have the option of either saying \u201cOur year-end sales were up 25%\u201d OR \u201cOur year-end sales (pause) were up (pause) twenty (pause) five (pause) percent.\u201d This is much more powerful.\nAs you can see, your nonverbal language communicates a great deal to your audience.\nThe more you present, the more confident and comfortable \nyou will feel.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the nonverbal cues of your audience.\nANALYZE YOUR AUDIENCE\u2019S \nNONVERBAL LANGUAGE\nThere is nothing more unnerving to a presenter than standing in front of a group of people for the first time. It could be 50, 500 or 1,000 people. What\u2019s different is that you are often put outside your comfort zone. So why not treat that presentation to a larger group just like you would a one-on-one conversation?\nHere are some nonverbal cues for you to be aware of during \nyour presentation that could help improve your future presentations:\n\u2022 The energy level in the room drops.  You \nhave a feeling that your audience isn\u2019t energized by your content. Unfortunately, sometimes a presenter can begin to lose energy or interest in his or her own presentation because of how they are interpreting the audience\u2019s behavior. Now would be a good time to use a different approach. Share a short anecdote. Tell a story. Ask a powerful, thought-provoking question. Give a startling statistic. Anything that shakes up your audience will do. If they were with you all along, they\u2019ll be with you even more. If they weren\u2019t with you, they certainly will be now. The more energy you put out to your audience, the more energy they will return to you. It all begins with you.\u2022 One person in the audience is distracting you.\n What happens when you begin focusing on one \nperson who you think is not interested in what you have to say? You make that judgment as a presenter rather quickly. The person\u2019s nonverbal language is \u201cspeaking\u201d to you. Sometimes you are right. And sometimes you are wrong. Don\u2019t get distracted by that one person\u2026who may have been up all night with a colicky baby and is falling asleep because of that rather than your content. Here\u2019s my personal experience:\nSeveral years ago, while delivering a full-day training \nprogram, I noticed a woman who \u2013 to me \u2013 seemed disengaged. She was looking down a lot. She wasn\u2019t smiling or laughing at my humor. I was convinced that she wasn\u2019t enjoying my program. (This is what we call \u201cnegative self-talk\u201d). After the program ended, as I reviewed the evaluation sheets, I came across hers. I was fully expecting her to give me a 1 or 2 out of 5 points. Instead, she gave me all 5\u2019s and added the comment, \u201cI would attend any future programs facilitated by Christine.\u201d Whoa. That was not the response I expected. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. When we try to read other people\u2019s nonverbal cues, sometimes we are right and sometimes we are wrong. Remember that the next time you try to read one person in your audience.\n\u2022 You are seeing a bored look on everyone\u2019s faces.\n If you are using a PowerPoint presentation to \naccompany your remarks, click on the B button on your computer to go to black screen.

Most \npresenters, though, follow the opposite school of thought that \u201cmore is more\u201d and stuff their slides with too many words and pictures. The result is summed up in another quote by author, entrepreneur and presentation expert Seth Godin who said, \u201cAlmost every PowerPoint sucks rotten eggs.\u201d\nIn a survey regarding what viewers disliked most about \nPowerPoint presentations, they identified the following problems.\nThe fundamental issue is that presenters try to put too much \non their slides. I think there are two groups of PowerPoint \nabusers who think that more words and pictures are better: intentional and unintentional abusers.INTENTIONAL POWERPOINT ABUSERS\nPeople intentionally overstuff their slides because it takes pressure off of them as presenters. For most people, the mere act of speaking in front of a group makes them go \nweak in the knees. In my \n\u201cBe A Better Business \nSpeaker\u201d program , I ask someone in the audience to \ndescribe their job. They calmly begin to rattle off some of their \nresponsibilities. Then I ask them to stand up and continue. In almost every case, they are suddenly stricken by fear. Being a presenter is frightening.\nIf all the information is on the slide, then presenters don\u2019t \nhave to worry about doing as much work and are less likely to embarrass themselves. The audience can just read the slides to get the necessary information. This, however, is a tedious process for the audience and raises the question: if all the information is on the slides, why not just distribute it as a handout? That\u2019s a much more efficient \u2013 and much less painful \u2013 communication method.\nUNINTENTIONAL POWERPOINT ABUSERS\nMost overstuffed slides, though, are the product of the unintentional abusers. They misunderstand their role as a presenter and the needs of their audience.\nThe presenters role is to be the source of most of the \ninformation. The slides play a supporting role rather than being the star. The slides should include just the key points, never full sentences. Short, concise bullet points provide visual reinforcement for the presenter\u2019s words. They also serve as a visual outline that guides the presenter and audience through the content, and increase the likelihood that the audience will recall the information.\nA widely used rule of thumb is the 6 X 6 rule; slides should \nhave no more than six bullets and each bullet should have no more than six words. That is probably too limiting, but provides good perspective on how much text should appear on a slide.\nRegarding the needs of the audience, presenters seem to \nassume their viewers have the visual acuity of a hawk, able to spot a mouse at 100 yards. When the font size on your slides gets below 14 point, you aren\u2019t creating a presentation, you\u2019re creating an eye chart.\nI\u2019ve also seen many slides that look like Christmas trees, chock \nfull of pictures and graphs that the presenter believes help provide knowledge. They usually don\u2019t. What they provide is clutter and eye strain. It is almost always better to use one or two carefully chosen pictures or graphs.\nPowerPoint Peeves\n74%  \nPresenters reading slides to them \n52%  \nFull sentences instead of bullet points\n48% \nText too small to read\n 330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        36  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "7efadcf2-5e46-4604-ada2-f4ae49261188", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "466f50d236e240c6d0feb9d00a90f05045a95b8bcc4f9e3d7eea7c443d5212fa", "extra_info": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3524, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "3759ddea-54bc-407c-82fe-6dfb771fd019"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "057e71af-d7da-4b2b-9b0f-b2827964381e": {"__data__": {"text": "Not sure if you are guilty of overstuffing your slides? If you\u2019ve \never had to tell your audience, \u201cI know you can\u2019t see this ...\u201c, then you are a PowerPoint abuser.\nBUT THEY NEED TO SEE THIS!\nThe most-common defense of slide overstuffers is that \u201cthe audience needs to see this!\u201d Often they don\u2019t, but let\u2019s assume they do. Putting it on the slide doesn\u2019t ensure they can see it if the text and graphics are too tiny. You have two solutions for this dilemma.\nIf it is critical that they see the information during the \npresentation, then use more slides. Spread the content across as many slides as is needed to ensure that each is clearly readable. One of the most-common battles I fight with clients is slide count. They fret that they will have too many slides in their presentations if they start dividing too-dense slides across multiple slides. Slide count is a meaningless metric. I can create one slide that, with animations, looks like 10. If it\u2019s truly important for your audience to see all that information, then use all the slides you need to ensure they are readable.\nSolution two is a handout or take-away document - but not \njust a printout of your overstuffed slides. If you have a report you need to reference, a checklist you need to review, a document you need to discuss, don\u2019t just scrunch it down to fit on the slide and expect your audience to squint their way through it. Instead, create a separate document that you distribute during your presentation as a reference. On your slides, pull out each key point from the document and make a slide of it.INVEST IN BETTER SLIDES  \nIt\u2019s easy to create a deck of slides bulging with words and images. Refining those slides, reducing them to the key points or pictures, and possibly preparing supporting handouts does take some thought and time. Mark Twain famously said, \u201cI am sorry for the long letter. I didn\u2019t have time to write a short one.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re concerned about effectively communicating with your \naudience, it\u2019s worth taking the time to reduce your word-filled slides to concise bullet points that keep the focus on you to ensure more effective communication.\n(If you\u2019ve been wondering, \n\u201cLess is more\u201d  comes \nfrom an 1855 poem, but is typically associated with architect \nLudwig Mies van der Rohe regarding his minimalist design.)  \n WWW.KENT.EDU/YOURTRAININGPARTNER         37  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "057e71af-d7da-4b2b-9b0f-b2827964381e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ea2de5e027f55ad590b0dbc174f6dfa0b206d17932a1addb8d2690c67ca591d0", "extra_info": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2387, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4ccc194d-d5a1-475a-b60e-b74eb5dc321d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f29f1d2a-527b-4e22-9a95-a4b8d4a0eec0": {"__data__": {"text": "HOW TO THINK ON YOUR FEET\nWritten By: Kent State Facilitator Christine Zust\nOne of the most common questions that is asked during my \npresentation skills training program is \u201cHow can I better think on my feet?\u201d You see, people may feel well prepared to deliver content, yet they feel unprepared to elaborate further on that content or they may fall apart when answering questions. Thinking on your feet spans three important areas that will be covered in this article, including: When presenting information, when elaborating and when answering questions. The key to thinking well on your feet is to decide the best approach to presenting information in a clear, concise and thoughtful way. \nWHEN PRESENTING INFORMATION:\n\u2022 Be fully present. To be present in the moment \nrequires mindfulness and self-awareness. There should be nothing else on your mind except the information you are presenting. Don\u2019t get sidetracked by self-talk about yourself (\u201cWhy is everyone staring at me?\u201d \u201cDo I look okay?\u201d \u201cDo I sound stupid?\u201d) or about something else on your mind (\u201cDid I leave that confidential paper on my desk?\u201d). When you are fully present, you are living in that moment alone. You are bringing your best self to the presentation. You are fully aware of everything you are saying and doing. A great tool to help with presence is deep breathing. Awareness of your breath anchors you in the present.\n\u2022 Focus.  People will often claim that they are experiencing \na brain freeze, they forget what they want to say, or they can\u2019t string together two coherent sentences. Lack of focus comes from a cluttered mind, filled with too many thoughts. Take a moment to clear your mind. Remind yourself of what you need to do here. What information do you have to share?\n\u2022 Speak from your knowledge base. When you \nknow your topic extremely well, you are best equipped to think on your feet because you are sharing what you know best. People who often struggle with thinking on their feet are either absolutely terrified of speaking in public or they may not have an extensive knowledge of the topic. Lacking a deeper level of knowledge, they may be more prone to offering vague, ambiguous content. Know your topic, and you will be able to handle anything.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t ramble. There is nothing more deadly than \nlistening to a presenter who rambles. Example (and I know you have sat in and witnessed people like this): \u201cLet me elaborate on this concept a bit more\u2026Two days ago, I met with John Hopkins, CEO of Hopkins International.  He\u2019s been a big client of ours for more than 15 years. I know his kids and his wife. We\u2019ve socialized with them \nover the years. He\u2019s a great guy, you know? We need \nmore clients like him, because he gets it. He understands \nour business, and we certainly understand his. I mean, I remember when his company was just getting started, and we were one of the first outside vendors he used, so we have history with him, right? So anyway\u2026\u201d Yada yada yada. That\u2019s what rambling sounds like. Much of that extra fluff isn\u2019t necessary, especially when the time allowed for business meetings keeps decreasing. Which leads me to my next point\u2026\n\u2022 Get to the point quickly! One of the greatest \ndesires of senior-level executives is this: Get to the point quickly. Stack the information so you are presenting a statement first, then backing it up with more information, not the other way around where you keep the audience guessing until you deliver the big reveal (your main statement).\nWHEN ELABORATING INFORMATION:\n\u2022 Expand your thought or idea.  Often when you \nare presenting, you may feel the need to go off script to elaborate or explain something more clearly. You may sense a lack of energy around the topic or content. Use an example. Share a short anecdote. \u201cLet me elaborate on this concept a bit more so you understand how it applies to our own Going Green Initiative here at the ABC Company.

It is good to set a short example that will help get your point across. What is not good is going on and on and on and on.\n\u2022 Respond on the spot. Someone may briefly \ninterrupt you on the spot and ask you to elaborate on what you just shared. Elaboration simply means to explain something in a deeper way by providing more detailed information. When someone asks you the question, \u201cCould \nyou elaborate on this idea a little more?\u201d then ask yourself \nthis question: \u201cWhat is the most important information I \nneed to share to get my point across?\u201d\nWHEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS:\n\u2022 Listen to key words and phrases. What is \nbeing asked of you? If someone asks a broad question, drill down to the specifics. For instance, \u201c Jane recently attended the AMA\u2019s annual marketing conference in San Diego. Jane, give us some highlights of the conference.\u201d The key phrase here is \u201cconference highlights.\u201d You can respond to this question in one of two ways. First, you could answer this question at face value and create your own interpretation of what you believe the phrase \u201cconference highlights\u201d means. Second, you could ask a clarifying question, such as, \u201cWhat specifically would you like me to highlight?\u201d To this, you may get a response like, \u201cWhat were two or three innovative ideas that you took away from the conference that you think we could apply within our marketing department?\u201d That is quite a different direction. It\u2019s much more specific. Now Jane can work with focused words like \u201cinnovative ideas\u201d and \u201capply.\u201d Unless Jane brought conference notes with her to this meeting (which she may not have), Jane now faces the daunting task of sifting through her memory. There\u2019s a lot of stuff in there. How does she sort through? How does she recall? How does she do this when all eyes are staring at her right at this very minute? She quickly thinks of marketing\u2019s many areas, like promotion, publicity, advertising, sales, customer relations, to name a few. What stands out? \nShe recalls what she learned by looking at each of these \nareas of marketing. \u201cWhat did I learn about customer \nrelations? What did I learn about sales?\u201d She can also tap her memory by using her senses. \u201cWhat did I see? Hear? Feel?\u201d She may remember a few powerful visual images of \na model to track customer inquiries. Now she has recalled \nand can share several innovative ideas. If she needs to, she \nquickly jots down a few notes on her note pad, and she\u2019s ready to respond.\u2022 Be prepared. There is a lesson from Jane\u2019s \nexample above. Be prepared. Never go into any meeting unprepared. When you attend an industry conference, be prepared for people to ask you about it. If you met with one of the biggest clients recently, you know you will be asked about that meeting. When you understand how people think, and the kind of information they desire, you can anticipate their needs. The person who effortlessly answers an \u201cunexpected\u201d question is someone who anticipated that question. Being prepared can earn you the reputation of someone who thinks well on their feet. Your secret? You simply prepare.\n\u2022 Share what you know. Thinking on your feet does \nnot mean making up stuff! We\u2019ve all sat in a room when a person was asked a question, and you could tell that the person was not only unprepared but had no idea what was being said. If the question is outside your expertise, simply state that. If Stephanie is better qualified to answer that question, direct it to her.\n\u2022 Take notes if needed. I\u2019m kinesthetic, which \nmeans that I take a lot of notes. If I have something important to say, or have a question that I want to ask, or have a question I need to answer, I often write it on my note pad because I fear that I will forget what I want to say.

Improvisation exercises will train your brain to think on the spot.\nHonestly, some people think on their feet better than others. You may not be able to magically change yourself into that other person. Instead, work with your strengths. Simply improve upon your natural abilities and talents.\nLearning to think on your feet is a skill that will serve you well \nthroughout your career. It has less to do with speed and more to do with accuracy, giving people the information they need. \nRemember that \nthinking on your feet  can happen \nwhen you are presenting or elaborating information and when \nyou are answering questions.

Well-\nwritten Subject lines will greatly increase the chance that your \nemail will not only be opened but get the desired response, and get it more quickly.\nPeople who tally such things say that the average business \nperson receives more than 100 emails every work day. Imagine \nthose emails in your Inbox as books on a shelf. Now imagine those books have titles on the spine like \u201cQuestion?\u201d and \u201cProject Update\u201d and \u201cNeed Help!\u201d None of those commonly \nseen email Subject lines is going to be of any help to the reader \nin figuring out what the emails contain, or encourage the \nrecipient to open and act on the email. What\u2019s inside the email is a total mystery to the recipient.\nDon\u2019t be the Agatha Christie of business communication by \nmaking your emails a mystery. The first and most important way to make your Subject lines work harder for you is to craft them to actually inform the recipient about the contents. Use the Subject line to let the reader know what it contains and, when appropriate, what the reader needs to do.\nReplace \u201cQuestion\u201d with \u201cQuestion about location for Kent State writing skills training\u201d\nReplace \u201cProject Update\u201d with \u201cQuarterly project update \ninformation: Onboarding process improvement\u201dReplace \u201cNeed help!\u201d with \u201cNeed help covering reception desk week of June 10\u201d\nDo those Subject lines take a bit longer to write? Yes, a few seconds, but the very small additional time will be more than repaid in faster, better responses.\nStand Out from the Crowd\nWhen you open your email and see the Inbox crowded with new messages, you scan them. Which ones scream for attention and which can you ignore for now? Strong Subject lines make your emails scannable. At a glance, the recipient can tell whether your email requires their immediate attention.\nJust as important, the recipient can tell if they don\u2019t need to \nattend to your email immediately. Many, possibly most, emails are informational CC\u2019s that require no action by recipient. Your readers will greatly appreciate it if you help them instantly identify the emails they can defer for later attention.\nOn the (Audit) Trail\nThe benefits continue even after the reader has opened, responded to and filed or deleted your email. One of the major values of email communication is that it provides a record of the conversation, an audit trail that can be followed to determine what was said or done by whom and when.That audit trail is often hard to follow, though, due largely to opaque Subject lines. Your searches for specific emails will be made much easier if your Subject line includes the key words you are likely to use when looking for that email later.\n WWW.KENT.EDU/YOURTRAININGPARTNER         41 ", "doc_id": "d73194df-afca-4df4-ad83-323a270949e8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c2156e879d3705aba320683a5fb90ca9348d857b5b4a3ff8b6fdab9c4a4daafd", "extra_info": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2882, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "0c64085e-7c7d-4e9e-8502-dcc3780696fb"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6604555-9f9f-40a0-854b-783f209c9732": {"__data__": {"text": "My work is project based, so every email begins with the name \nor an acronym for the related project.

Some attendees find this technique annoying but most leave the course eager to put it to work for them.\nFor information or action requests you can communicate in a \nsingle sentence, make that sentence the Subject line and leave the body of the email blank. Examples might look like these:\nStrong Email Subject Lines\nI understand how some email writers could be concerned that \nthis technique feels overly curt or that it might confuse the reader. My experience has been that recipients appreciate the technique because it makes it so fast and easy to glean the content and respond. In a few seconds, they can deal with your email and have the satisfaction of clearing an item from their Inbox.Some participants in the email program said that they \nclarify for the recipient that the Subject line contains the \nentire message by adding the suffix \u201cEOM\u201d (end of message) \nor characters like \u201c|||\u201d at the end of the Subject. My email \nrecipients seem to figure it out with no suffixes required.\nBoost Your Email Effectiveness\nResearch shows that within five seconds of viewing an email, \nthe recipient will decide whether to respond, delete or defer it. A clear, action-oriented Subject line makes it much more likely that they will act as soon as the they see it. Business emails generally have one of two purposes: Share information or get action. Either way, stronger Subject lines will help accomplish your communication goal.\nStrong Email Subject Lines\n\u2022 Lean Training Event:\nPlease send attendee roster by \nMonday morning\n\u2022 Leadership Skills Program:Plan to arrive at 7:30 a.m.\n\u2022 Customer Service Course:How many workbooks needed?\n 330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        42  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS  BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS", "doc_id": "c6604555-9f9f-40a0-854b-783f209c9732", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "032af1c7087316b79634671dcf7199527d67f2ad2d5e81bc2aef5ba2e03f01a5", "extra_info": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2594, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4695ef92-ebc4-4e03-80c6-a4e91140583e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "93bd10cb-bcaa-41f2-b5c4-05d30a3917b7": {"__data__": {"text": "GET TO THE POINT\nWritten By: Kent State Facilitator Tim Kraft\nIn the movie The Point! (one of my favorites) a boy named \nOblio was the only round-headed person in the Pointed Village. By village law everyone and everything must have a point, so Oblio was banished from his home to The Pointless Forest. He met many odd characters in the forest, notably The Pointed Man. Oblio thought it odd that The Pointless Forest was home to a man who was constantly pointing. When asked about this conundrum, The Pointed Man explained \u201cA point in every direction is the same as no point at all.\u201d\nIn almost all business writing and presentations, you are \ntrying to make a point. You hope to communicate something you want your audience to know, do or feel. Many business communicators, unfortunately, don\u2019t do a very good job of making their point. The primary problem is that they bury their point in too many words, making it difficult for their audience to find or recognize it.\nSmaller Is Better\nYour readers, like you, are deluged with information and operate in a constant state of partial attention. Many of them are multi-taskers (despite scientific evidence that multi-tasking isn\u2019t an efficient strategy), so your messages have to cut through the blizzard of communication your readers face.Studies have shown that within five seconds of glancing at an email, the recipient will decide whether to read and respond, postpone or ignore it. Compressing your communications to their most-compact size will greatly increase the likelihood that recipients will immediately read and respond to your email.\nHarry Houdini offers additional support for using the smallest \nnumber of words possible. A regular part of his act was to invite audience members onto the stage. He would give several people 20-foot-long pieces of rope or chain and encourage them to tie him up as tightly as possible.\nOnce the audience members had done their best, Houdini \ndisappeared into a sack and, after some theatrical thrashing about, emerged with the bindings in hand. The secret Houdini knew was that it is easier to escape from a long piece of rope. The longer the rope, the more slack \u2013 and the easier for him to escape.\nWriting is like that. The more words you use, the easier it is for \nyour meaning to escape.\nWrite Less to Communicate More\nHow to ensure your message won\u2019t escape and you will succeed in making your point? A key tactic is to edit ruthlessly. In your first draft, let your fingers fly. Use all the words you want. Once you\u2019ve finished your first draft, though, get your finger over the Delete key.\n\u2022 As you review the document, think about the point you are \ntrying to make. Constantly ask yourself \n\u201cdoes this \ntext help make my point?\u201d  If not, \ndelete it.\nNow the harder work begins. What words can you eliminate? \nWhat things can you say more succinctly? In journalism speak, how can you \u201ctighten the copy?\u201d\nOnce you start looking for them, wasted words are \neverywhere. In my Be a Better Business Writer program, attendees are always amused by my example of the gigantic banner above a tanning salon near my house. The banner reads, \u201cFree Tanning \u2013 Inquire Within.\u201d When asked what words were wasted, attendees quickly identify \u201cinquire within.\u201d If there\u2019s a banner above a tanning salon that says \u201cfree tanning,\u201d is there really any doubt about where to go for that freebie?\n WWW.KENT.EDU/YOURTRAININGPARTNER         43 ", "doc_id": "93bd10cb-bcaa-41f2-b5c4-05d30a3917b7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b6ecf305802dfc2cd4721c49ce079490ec3e2b85f73bf287b5b9541bcd758874", "extra_info": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3422, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4a383965-293c-4b11-a06d-5783165b9073"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a829400-ee21-4c70-93b8-42b6ef439823": {"__data__": {"text": "Here\u2019s a surprising way to pare your writing down a bit: you \ncan almost always delete the word \u201cthat.\u201d The next time you are proofreading something, see if you can delete every one of them.

This, it turns out, is more difficult than it sounds, but with practice can greatly condense and improve your writing. Most people write to be read. Instead, try writing to be heard.

After reading them, I still don\u2019t know what the author wants from me. If you have experienced this, or have noticed this in your own writing, then read on for a few tips on streamlining your writing, which can be applied to any form of business writing (emails, reports, proposals, etc.).\nOne of the biggest impediments to \nclear communication is that people often bury their main \npoint or their \u201caction items\u201d (things they want you to do) in the middle of the email or document. Everyone is busy and all our time is valuable. We don\u2019t have time to read every email carefully, and most of us are guilty of skimming. When the main point is buried in the middle, it\u2019s too easy to skim right past it. If your writing buries the lead like this, it may be necessary for your audience to re-read your email. This is a problem because you risk losing your audience.\nThink about this: On average, when you get a new email \nin your inbox, how many seconds do you spend  \nskimming that email before you decide that you can come \nback to it later ? (My answer to this is below.) The problem \nwith this is that we all know that later doesn\u2019t always come \naround, especially if more urgent things call us away.\nI ask the above question to all the groups that I train in \nbusiness writing . The results of my informal survey are quite \ninteresting. I\u2019ve found that on average, people are willing to \ngive three-to-five seconds  before they decide they \ncan come back to it later. This is an important number to keep \nin mind (3-5 seconds) because it means that we have just that long to convey our most important information. That means our message must be clear and easily understood.\nI believe that the reason \n\u201cmud\u201d  exists in writing today is \nbecause of the fast-paced nature of our businesses. Email, \nchats, text, everything is instantaneous. I\u2019ve met people who must constantly check their email and they\u2019ll write and send a response within two minutes of receiving a message. That\u2019s exactly how \u201cmud\u201d enters our writing. When we type before we think (or at the same time we are thinking) our typing tends to wander (much like our thinking). We make our way toward our point in a general direction, but we may forget to mention something, then remember later and include it further down in the message. The danger here is of repeating some information; especially if it\u2019s not crucial information. By thinking before we write, we can keep our writing more narrowly focused and more efficient.\nMy #1 Rule of Business Writing\nIn order to help keep your message clear:\nAlways remember: The Middle is Mud!\nWhat does this mean? It means that whatever you put in the \nmiddle is most likely to get lost. This could be in the middle of a long sentence, the middle of a paragraph or the middle of your email.\nHere are \nfour easy techniques with explanations and \nexamples to help you get rid of the mud.\nEffectively use \u201cwhite space\u201d\na. Empty space around text will more easily draw \nour eye to that point. This can be achieved in many \ndifferent ways, such as adding an extra blank line before and after your main point, arranging important content in an indented paragraph or having a list of short text (putting white space on the right margin as well as the left, from the indentation).\nBreak the big paragraph into smaller   paragraphs\na. This makes it less intimidating and easier for the \nreader to follow. Additionally, if the reader is interrupted (as so often happens now, by the computer, phone or even a live person) they can more easily find where they left off and continue reading without wasting any time.\n WWW.KENT.EDU/YOURTRAININGPARTNER         45 1\n2", "doc_id": "5c185456-4287-4ad6-a692-97c4af291fd9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "78b9cd1b28ace362f6b7d4cb6d259cd1818ace77330e31626bfb0077afc25720", "extra_info": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3825, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "cd288ac5-cb44-40db-8a8a-92a86864941c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "eab57278-be88-4511-817f-0bda417e8a17": {"__data__": {"text": "Use lists or tables to effectively \ndisplay your information\na. Not only do both lists and tables create some additional white space (lending them more importance) but they also make your content easier to read and remember.\ni. Lists \u2013 Short and easy to follow. Lists are great for showing connections between things (like steps in a process) or showing unrelated things in the same general category (such as a list of all your favorite foods or all of this month\u2019s Purchase Orders).\nii. Tables \u2013Clearly labeled and with a little white \nspace between rows and columns. Tables are great for comparing attributes or details (such as comparing the specs to two different smartphones, you\u2019re thinking of buying or explaining the difference between two service packages your company offers) and for displaying lots of numerical data.\n1. Text  \u2013 If you want to use text in a table, it \nshould be left aligned and be very concise. If necessary, you can add a note or legend outside the table to provide additional information.\n2. Numbers \u2013 If you\u2019re showing many different \nnumbers, I strongly recommend using the \u201cdecimal tab\u201d in Word (click on the toggle switch in the top-left corner and it looks like an upside-down \u2018 T \u2019 with a \u2018 . \u2019 on the right side. \nFormat numbers efficiently\na. When displaying numerical data it\u2019s important that all the data be formatted in a way that is easy to \nread. For this we have a couple of options:\ni. You can list your numbers in-line as a list. If you do this, separate the numbers with a semicolon. (Such as: 2,456.25; 105.26; 45,687.10; 648.04)\nii. You can also put your numbers in a list or table. \nThis gives the benefit of the reader being able to skim the numbers and find a particular number or have a look for trends.*NOTE* If you do decide to display your information this way, \nI \nstrongly recommend that you use a decimal tab \nto align your data. This is done with the toggle switch in the \ntop-left corner of Word, where you see the ruler displayed. \n(Pictured below)  Note that the shape is like an upside-\ndown T with a \u201c.\u201d on the right hand side.\nNow that I\u2019ve introduced you to these techniques, I\u2019ve \nincluded examples so that you can more easily visualize the benefit this formatting will have for your writing.\nIn the following examples, I\u2019ve changed the formatting, but \nkept the information (squiggles, in this case) the same, and even kept the same amount \u2013 go ahead and count them if you don\u2019t believe me.\nWall-O-Text\nFirst, let\u2019s look at what not to do.

Facilitator Nelson Canario\nNo, I\u2019m not talking about mind control, but something much \neasier. Follow the below steps and you can greatly increase the probability that your reader will do what you want. First, I believe that people, in general, are helpful (but to a limit). They are willing to spend some (short) time to do what you ask of them. The key is how much time they are willing to spend.\nWe get a first impression of someone in person in 15 to 30 \nseconds. Well, for writing it\u2019s actually much shorter than that! According to my own informal survey, most people only give a new email or letter three to five seconds before they decide that it can wait. Therefore, we must convey our key points within that short time frame.\nHere are three best practices to getting people to do what \nyou want through writing. All of these will help improve the effectiveness of your action items and main points.\nThese elements contribute to maximizing the chance that \nyour readers will see all of your action items and do them. Otherwise, they may miss one (or more). In the worst case, they won\u2019t do any of them.\nIf the readers can find your action items in three to five \nseconds, then they already know what you want from them before they decide not to read any further.Now, let\u2019s look at each of those three elements in more detail to see how you can apply them in your writing.\n1. Easy to Find\nThe Middle is Mud\nRemember my #1 Business-writing \nrule: The middle is \u201cmud.\u201d  How fast \ncan you find what the reader needs, in the sample below?\nWe (Jack Johnson and I) would like to get clarification on the policy and guidelines with regard to customer/distributor notifications. Specifically, what can we send electronically and what we must send as hard copy? This request is in general; I am not concerned if we are under contract with a customer or distributor because the contact states specifically how the notification has to be delivered.\nLet\u2019s try it a different way:\nQuestion:\nPlease clarify what we can send electronically and what \nwe must send as hard copy.\nBackground:Jack Johnson and I are confused about the policy \nand guidelines with regard to customer/distributor notifications. This request is in general; I am not concerned if we are under contract with a customer or distributor because the contact states specifically how the notification has to be delivered.\nIn order to keep your action items out of the mud, put \nthem as close to the top as possible. This means that your reader will come to your action items sooner, rather than later. The optimal position for action items may vary with your specific situation.\nPersusasion\nWriting persuasively often requires your main point to be at the bottom, especially when writing to someone who already has an opposing view of the topic. You first want to present reasonable points that are easy to agree to, and build your case. Then once you\u2019ve got them nodding their head in agreement, point out why your main point is valid.If you must put your action item in the middle (which is sometimes unavoidable), check out my advice on how to get rid of mud. \n 330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        48 1.

This will help you to organize your \ninformation in a way that \nis easy for the reader to \nunderstand quickly.\nGood formatting Be aware of how your \ndocument looks, and \nhow comfortable it is \nto read. Don\u2019t just think \nabout paragraphs, but also numbers or different \ntypes of data that you \nmay include.\n \nHow to Use the Mud\nThat being said, rules are made to be broken, and there\u2019s \nalways an exception. There is, in fact, a legitimate reason you might want to separate your action items. In this case, you will substitute \u201cKey Points\u201d for \u201cAction Items,\u201d as the techniques are the same. This particular situation is one that may be familiar to you. I\u2019m talking about the Pre-Approved Credit Card junk mail that is so common.\nThink about the credit card advertisement. When you first \nsee it, what jumps off the page at you? It\u2019s always the low interest rate. Think about how they emphasize that low APR. They make the text size huge and leave white space around it to draw your attention.\nHowever, they de-emphasize other features like annual \nfees, late payment fees, etc. We call it \u201cfine print\u201d for a good reason! You can bet it will be buried in the \u201cmud.\u201d\nThe only time I recommend putting your key points in \nthe middle is when you\u2019re delivering bad news and want to \u201chide\u201d it as much as possible. The same can be done verbally; some people call it \u201cthe compliment sandwich.\u201d First, you say something nice about someone, and then something that you want them to improve, and you finish with another compliment. You bury the bad news in the \u201cmud.\u201d2. Easy to Understand\nTo make action items clear and easy to understand, it is essential to consider the amount of relevant details. In order to decide how much detail to include, think first about your purpose and your audience.\nPurpose\nWhat are you trying to accomplish?\nIf you do not have this clearly in mind before you begin \nwriting, how will the reader be able to figure it out? Some common purposes are to:\n\u2022 Provide information\n\u2022 Request information or help\n\u2022 Persuade the reader to your side\n\u2022 Seek agreement or confirmation, i.e. time of a meeting\nYour purpose will influence how much detail you need to include. If you are just relaying the results of the meeting last Thursday, don\u2019t include a transcript of the discussion; I only need to know what decisions were reached so that I can complete my tasks.\nAudience\n\u2022 Who are your readers?\n\u2022 What do they want?\n\u2022 How much do they know?\n\u2022 How much do they need to know?\nConsidering these questions will help you to get into the mind of your reader. Remember: unless it is a diary, you are not writing for yourself. You\u2019re writing so that someone else can read what you\u2019ve written and understand a specific idea.

Unless you\u2019re writing technical instructions for a laboratory procedure using volatile chemicals you probably don\u2019t need lots of technical jargon.\n3. Grouped Together\nThis sounds like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s surprising how often I find action items sprinkled all throughout the document. I\u2019ve often seen emails that have a nice list of three action items. Then, at the bottom, just above the closing, they say something like:\n\u201cOh, and please email Sam and let him know what you\u2019ve decided.\u201d\nThat is an action item. It should be above with the others. In this case, it\u2019s very easy to miss that last-minute addition. This is precisely why I say that all action items should be grouped together, so that the reader doesn\u2019t have the chance to miss one.Accommodating Different Readers\nThis can be a tricky thing. If you have been working on a project for the past month, and now you need to loop in someone else on the project team to give support, it\u2019s quite likely that that person will not know the history of the project or the relevant background information. However, if you send an email to the entire team with all the background information, that is unnecessary for them, you risk them not reading the entire message and thereby losing some action items.\nIn this scenario, you have two options:\n1. Write a separate email to the new team member to \ncatch him/her up on what you\u2019ve been doing.\n2. Start including the new team member on group emails AND put a background section at the bottom of the message (below your action items).\nI prefer the second option. Make sure that your background section is clearly labeled with a subtitle. Using subtitles in your writing has benefits for both the writer and the reader. What are those benefits? I\u2019ve listed them below for you.\nWhy use subtitles?\nBenefits for writer\n\u2022 Allows you to write faster, since the outline is apparent.\n\u2022 Allows you to stay on track. If you are interrupted, it\u2019s easy to pick up where you left off.\nBenefits for readers\n\u2022 Allows them to choose to read OR skip a section, such as the background.\n\u2022 Allows them to refer to document easily in the future.\nTry some of these tips to help you improve the quality of your action items. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be pleased with the \nresults.\n BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS  330-672-3416  \u25aa   EMAIL YOURTRAININGPARTNER@KENT.EDU        50 ", "doc_id": "9992a545-add5-4cf3-ab67-416095c60561", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d7d7afb2512a03ce116302432d827cd8cfadfb8f5b34d3e8629d67042a2c97f9", "extra_info": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "Kent State University_20 ways to Enhance Your Communication Skills.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2570, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "41cac30d-35c4-451a-80c2-2f10e64692b7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "78442488-8a27-4b1d-b385-3028d47d6917": {"__data__": {"text": "KENT STATE UNIVERSITY\u2019S \nCENTER FOR CORPORATE AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT\nKent State University\u2019s Center for Corporate and Professional Development provides employee \ntraining and development in a broad range of competencies, including supervisory, management and leadership development, human resources, project management, continuous improvement and all the softer skills such as dealing with conflict and change, team building, interpersonal communication skills, business writing, among many others.\nOur facilitators come to your organization, tailor the training and deliver it on-site.

There is a high potential for business growth in selling bakery products. In the business \nworld, Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are primarily engaged in the bakery business, but \ncannot compete with the branded bakery Industry. The SMEs in Malaysia are striving hard \nto achieve growth in the business of bakery products. The present case study deals with the \nissues faced by SMEs and provided some valid recommendations to resolve the existing \nproblems in the bakery business. The case analysis and its findings reveal that SMEs have \nunstructured marketing strategies and needs enhancements in the areas of packaging, value add \nto the bakery products, focus on promotion and appropriate advertising strategies. Further, the \nanalysis reveals that more coverage of selling points for bakery products, the increased number \nof distribution centers and proper incentives to the agents may definitely improve the marketing \nof bakery products.\nIntroduction\nRenko et al. (2011) suggested potential plans to \nimprove sustainable competing benefits for one of \nthe Croatian small bakery industry and the results \nsuggested to formulate a suitable marketing strategies \nto achieve future plan of actions. Constantin (2009) \nmentioned the importance of sales promotion of \nbakery products and provided the marketing strategy \nlayout. Aisha Food Industry Sdn. Bhd. (AFISB) \nestablished in 19 October 1992 and is one of SMEs \nin Malaysia. The Industry started as a family business \nand later changed from the traditional way to modern \nbusiness, thus a small family business converted to \nmedium enterprise industry. The buildup area of the \nplant of AFISB is about 8000 square feet and the \nauthorized capital of the company is US$150,000 \nwith the paid up capital is US$135,000. AFISB \nsells fresh daily-baked bread, cakes and cookies in \nMalaysia with the total sales per month is around \nUS$60,000. The major customers of AFISB are \ngovernment hospitals, government prisons and \nhostels in Malaysia. About 28 employees are working \nin AFISB to run the operations and routine activities. \nThe main purpose of this case study is to determine \nhow to improve the marketing strategies and sales for \nAFISB in particular and for those SMEs involved in \nthis business in general. In the customers judgment, \nAFISB uses level-B ingredients (products with \nslightly low quality) since their selling price is low compared to the standard bakery industries. Further, \nthe target group of AFISB is government hospitals; \nthey cannot sell their products at a higher price. Based \non the frequent personal field visits with the officials \nof AFISB, Malaysia, and the responses received from \n20 experts of similar groups of industries (SMEs), the \nfollowing critical issues were emerged:\nImprove marketing for bakery products and \nservices and develop new market to continue with \nthe existing marketing partners. Identify the potential \nadvertising sources (newspapers, billboard, bulletins, \nand business cards). Increase the number of agents in \nMalaysia and develop sales team with experienced \nmarketing", "doc_id": "5dc5d6d3-385e-42f2-82f4-49876d1520b4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a0a8d3c1a72a7f616d160cb8c7ed574db3589d9eecd9405fff758b1afd5dd3cd", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2102", "file_name": "Bakery strategy 2014.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3804, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b105353c-5adf-41d1-a3a4-727e71d333dc", "3": "593578db-adff-4270-b96b-26779eb957e5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "593578db-adff-4270-b96b-26779eb957e5": {"__data__": {"text": "the number of agents in \nMalaysia and develop sales team with experienced \nmarketing personnel.

For most \nof the Multinational companies in Malaysia, SMEs \nare the major suppliers. In fact, there is only a small \nrisk for SMEs in Malaysia if the existing MNCs \nmove out of Malaysia to lower labor cost countries \nlike China and India. Zulkifli-Muhammad  et al.  \n(2009) have elaborated on how SMEs can compete \nin the global business environment in the Malaysian \nperspectives. It is worthwhile to mention that SMEs \nin Malaysia particularly in the business of dairy \nproducts production are highly capable to carry out \npotential business with the help of stakeholders and \nlike-minded people to enlarge the business operations \nboth at business-to-business (B-B) and at business-\nto-customers (B-C) levels. \nAccording to the \u201cPassport Baked Goods in \nMalaysia\u201d (International Euromonitor, 2011), \nmore Malaysian customers changed their eating \nroutine in the direction of much healthier diet plans, \nwhich often lead to bread as a breakfast every day \nrather than local delicacies such as noodles and \nnasi lemak, literally \u2018fatty rice\u2019. Out of the baked \ngoods, packaged/industrial bread noted the quickest \ngrowing in Malaysia in the past year 2011, showed a \n4% increased value growing to US$0.6 billion when \ncompared to 2010. Unpackaged cakes also moved \nup comparable to high growth in 2011, because of \nincreasingly wide selection of unpackaged cakes that \nare available in Malaysia. The most preferred in-store \nbakery in Malaysia is located inside the outlets of \nCold Storage, Carrefour, and Giant, Tesco, and Jusco \noutlet stores. Bakery Business in Malaysia is popular, \nas the three major races of Malaysia namely Malay, \nChinese and Indians prefer bakery products not just \nfor their breakfast time but also for the whole food \nconsumption of the day. Gardenia Bakery KL Sdn. \nBhd. is the top ranked branded industry within baked \ngoods in Malaysia with 21% share value, followed \nby Stanson Bakeries Sdn. Bhd. with 11% share value. \nThe leading brands in packaged/industrial bread in \nMalaysia during 2013 were Gardenia and High 5, \nboth these companies produce bakery products that \nare widely acceptable by the consumers and regarded \nas an excellent source of well-balanced nutrition.\nIn the global scenario, Webster  et al. (2010) \nstudied the salt amount in breads that are above \nthe reasonable benchmarks. Louie  et al.  (2012) \nhave found that there was no significant difference \ndetected in nutritional composition of breakfast \ncereals between 2004 and 2010. Reshma  et al. (2012) investigated the fat content of selected labeled and \nunlabeled Indian bakery products. Campo and \nGijsbrechts (2004) suggested that the supermarkets \nshould primarily adjust the space shares of food \ncategories whereas the hypermarkets should adapt \nthe space shares of non-food categories based on \nthe local market conditions. Albisu  et al.  (2000), \nsuggested four competitiveness issues for the agro \nfood industries which are applicable to Spain. Gomez \net al.  (2004) constructed a statistical model to address \nnonlinearities and asymmetries which focus on the \nbehavioral consequences of customer satisfaction \nin the retail sector. Siro et al .

In Malaysia, SMEs favor for improving \nmarketing services through more investment and add \nvalue to the products. For instance, to produce better \nbakery products, one needs to look into improving \nquality and add value like texture, softness, better \ningredients, taste and attractive packaging. To \nachieve this, SMEs were opted to increase the selling \nprice of bakery products and attract new agents to \nboost the sales. The primary objective of this case \nstudy is to identify the current marketing strategies \nof SMEs and suggests improvements for marketing \nwhich enhances the sales and services of bakery \nproducts produced by them. The major issue in the \nbakery business is that the managers of SMEs engage \nin multitask activities like looking after operational, \nfinancial and non-financial matters and focus less \ntime to do the fieldwork. The other issue is pertaining \nto agents, as there are only few agents to look after \nthe marketing of bakery products. The SMEs spends \nfewer amounts for advertisements and there is no \nproper web page to most of the companies. Although, \nSMEs have high potential and openings in the future \nsince the demand for bakery products increase day \nby day in Malaysia. Meanwhile, Aisha Food Industry \nSdn. Bhd. (AFISB) is one of the SME Company \nproducing bread related products such as cream roll, \nburger, hot dog bun, yam slice cake, chocolate muffin, \nand assorted muffin. AFISB has many difficulties in \nmarketing these products. A questionnaire survey was \nconducted through personal interview method with \nthe top management people of Aisha Food Industry \nSdn. Bhd (AFISB). \nThe production and marketing strategies of \nAFISB have obtained to predict inferences on the \ncost cutting mechanism. The production details of \nAFISB are as follows:\nWith the existing machinery and capacity, AFISB \ncan produce 820 buns (includes bun / bread / cookies / \ncakes) per one bag (50 kg) of wheat flour. The current \nproduction of AFISB Bakery is 20,500 units of buns \nper day, which requires 25 bags of wheat flour. The \nestimated target for the year 2013 is 32,800 units of \nbuns per day, which requires 40 bags of wheat flour. \nDuring the year 2014, AFISB wishes to achieve the \nfull capacity of 49,200 buns per day, which requires \n60 bags of wheat flour. The loss during the year 2010 \nto the tune of US$ 20,000 and is due to initial set-up of the company in the form of new place, new \ncustomers, machinery and agents (Table 1).\nAFISB has better future if they have the following \n2-year (2013-2014) strategic plans to further growth.\nTwo-year plan (2013-2014)\nAFISB has to achieve sales of bakery products \nfrom US$ 2,000 to US$2,500 per day during 2013 \nand enhance to US$4,000 per day during 2014.  \nAFISB has to focus more on the sales of bakery \nproducts, expand the business and identify new \nagents.  Further, the wider coverage of sales has to be \nachieved particularly in the rural areas of Malaysia. \nThe loss to the extent of US$20,000 during the year \n2010 is due to the purchase of equipments and export \nbakery products to the neighboring countries of \nMalaysia (Table 2).\nResults and Discussion\nThe managers of AFISB wish to improve sales \nand marketing of bakery products. The company has \nenough capacity in terms of machinery and labor \nforce but they are not able to achieve the business \ntarget due to lack of marketing strategies.

Some weaknesses of the company include \nthe lack of a customer base and marketing aspects. \nThe company is new and the brand name is known \nonly to a certain section of customers. The company \nmust find ways to establish a larger customer base. \nIf some of the orders from government hospitals, \nhostels and prisons were cancelled then the company \nwill be in trouble in the end. It is imperative now, \nto find a suitable marketing strategy to improve the \nvolume of business to AFISB.\nFishbone analysis\nThe Fishbone analysis has been applied to deepen \nteam\u2019s understanding of a problem. AFISB has \nproduced bakery products with inferior raw materials \nas they sell products at low prices compared to other \ncompany products. However, the poor marketing \nstrategy of the company give room to identify the \ncauses for Fishbone-analysis. The market research \ngenerally has 6 M\u2019s to determine the needs of the \nconsumers and to develop the right products, with \nthe right characteristics. AFISB has the \u201cHALAL\u201d \nlogo symbol so that the Muslim friends can eat the \nbakery products manufactured by the company. With \nregard to packaging, AFISB products do not have \nall nutritional ingredients, message framing, contact \ninformation and certificate (Figure 1).\nSWOT Analysis\n SWOT  analysis  may be useful  to  determine  \nthe overall functional and operational  assessment   \nof the industry and  check  the  micro and macro \nenvironment . In the present study, the real business \nissue of AFISB has investigated through SWOT \nanalysis.\nStrengths \nAFISB has been in the bakery business for the \nlast 20 years and have loyal customers who have \nan interest in the company\u2019s bakery products. The company established some good relationship with \ngovernment agencies and institutions related banks \nto secure the government orders. The approach to \nget orders adopted by the company is still at its early \nstage, and the packaging design of the bakery products \nneeds to be improved. The packaging materials in the \nform of plastics have to be changed, as the quality is \nnot up to the standards. The new machine that can \nwithstand a high-level heat resistance is the need of \nthe hour. \nWeaknesses\nThe diversification of bakery products is \nnecessary, as the Malaysian market requires a high \nvolume of bakery products at low prices. AFISB is \nstill in an effort to produce a variety of new bakery \nproducts and product packaging. Although the \nmachine does packaging, the quality of the pocket \nis not up to satisfactory level. The packaging design \nwith no attractive color does not attract the new \ncustomers. Overall, the quality of the products has \nto be enhanced to ensure sales. Apart from the raw \nmaterials, the other factors such as place of preparation \nof products, steam room, oven play are also important \nin determining the quality of the product.\nOpportunities\nAFISB may go to the open market to increase the \nvolume of sales. The company is currently targeting \non the low - income group and they have to think in \nterms of covering middle-income group by producing \nhigh quality bakery products with competitive prices. \nThe company has good opportunities to connect their \nmarketing to the government schools by introducing \nfree products as promotional opportunities to start up. \nThe new business offering, keeping shops at strategic \nlocations and direct selling points may improve \nAFISB\u2019s volume of business. \nFigure 1.

Some \ncompetitors have the upper edge over this company \nas they sell green bakery products. Some orders \ngot by AFISB under the Ministry of Defense and \nMinistry of Home may go to other companies as the \ncompetition in the market is high. The increase in raw \nmaterial price and the fuel price may create problems \nto AFISB. The detailed descriptions in the form of \nSWOT analysis is provided in Figure 2.\nFrom the case study, it is clear that those SMEs \nwho are in bakery business needs to strategize costing, \nprofit margin, analysis of products and they should \nfocus on some value-added food for taste and increase \nquality. The proper packaging, good advertisement, \nweb attractions and healthier food with high fiber-\nless, sugar-low, low cholesterol, good looking may \nincrease the volume of business. To promote the \nmarketing of bakery products offered by SMEs, the \nfollowing salient features may be adopted: \nIdentify advertising sources (for true promotion) \nthrough multimedia presentation to promote \nmarketing with attractive website of the products \non pipeline. The proper advertising in the form of \nsignboards, posters, leaflets, cards billboards, printed \nadvertisements, mails, newspaper, TV , FM may \nsignificantly influence the promotion. AFISB has to \nincrease cash investment and Market capacity for \nfuture growth. The periodical comparison with top \ncompanies and market players to bakery products like \ngardenia, High 5 will definitely yield good results. \nSMEs engaged in doing bakery business might \nthink about preparing the list of agents or distributors \nfor cakes, bread, biscuits, cookies, and conduct a \nmarket survey to identify the best suitable agent \nfor their requirements. The creative promotional \nactivities may be introduced like founder\u2019s day 20% discount, buy one get one free and so on to attract \nagents and consumers.  Business fliers and business \ncards of the outlets portrayed so that the public may \nkeep informed about the business. The other way of \npromoting is by giving coupons and membership cards \nwith exclusive promotions. Nowadays, a customer \nlove freebies and discounts and is an effective way \nin pulling business volume.  In addition, identifying \nthe strength and weakness of the agents and provide \nthem with enough marketing training may improve \nthe sales growth. \nObservations and recommendations from the case \nstudy\nFigure 3 depicts the overall issues and problems \nfaced by AFISB and the recommendations to resolve \nthe issues are provide below:\nThe machine capacity of AFISB is not fully \nutilize, the machine idle time is 40%, and therefore the \nworking hours rescheduled from 7 am-11 pm instead \nof the existing 24 hours with two shifts. The current \nbrand ZARINA changed to some other brand with \nattractive packaging to unify the standardization for \nbetter production process of bakery items. Currently, \nthere are no proper scientific processing units and \nR&D and thus creating more time for management \nto focus on analyses and strategic activities may \nfetch good results. The distribution centers from the \ncurrent level of two increased to at least three centers. \nThe productivity of bakery products engaged by \nSMEs (AFISB) can be improved through efficiency \n(low operating costs, savings over idle machine time \nand reducing wastages), better procedures for buying \nbakery product materials, improved decision making \nand better staff morale and cooperation.\nIn view of the findings from AFISB, the principal \ninvestment is to be increase for business growth \nand AFISB must equip all employees and agents \nwith appropriate training. They should also realize \nthe corporate social responsibility (CSR) to impart \nbusiness ethics.

AFISB caters to the needs of low \nand medium ranged income group residing in \nMalaysia. The company manufactures a variety \nof bakery products including bread, bun, cake and \nrolls. AFISB has 28 employees with the turnover of \naround US$60,000 per month and the company has \nsome permanent orders from government hospitals, \ngovernment hostel and prisons. However, the company \nis not focusing good business in the private sectors \nand it does not have sales unit. The company has nine \nactive agents who do the business for the company. \nAFISB has faced with some challenges to resolve the \ncurrent marketing strategies. The company demands \nadvance cash payment from the agents and this \ncauses the major issues of poor marketing strategies. \nFurther, the agents also serve other companies in \naddition to AFISB, which is an additional constraint \nto the company. It is recommended that either the \ncompany may collect half of the purchase amount \nfrom the agents in advance or the agents may be \nasked to return the products that are unsold on the \nsame day with full payment of the sold products. The \ncompany is currently achieving 3% of marketing on \nbakery items and trying to increase sales from 3% \nto 5% during the next 2 years. The case analysis and \nits results suggest that AFISB has real problems in \nmarketing strategies and so it needs to improve its \npackaging, some value add to the bakery products, \nmore focus on promotion through proper media and \nadvertising strategies. The number of selling points \nfor bakery items, the increased number of distribution \ncenters and proper incentives to the existing agents \nwill definitely improve the sales of AFISB.

The employee strength \ngrew to 100 with this stupendous success. With close to 30 outlets both in and outside the state, Paris Bakery was a brand to reckon with. \nIn 2017 (Figure 3), Paris Bakery celebrated 1,000 days \nof operation with much fanfare. In order to give back to the society, Paris Bakery tied up with an NGO, SAHAYA to educate underprivileged girls. Once the turnover exceeded `320 million, it decided to expand its market beyond Odisha. To keep the hiring and business development plan organized and structured, Mr Jay started training professionals in the hospitality sector. In the meantime, Paris Bakery was awarded the best bakery chain by the government of Odisha in the month of September. It was a dream for the founder who left the comfortable position of Chief Operating Officer of The World Group (shopping complex chain) to pursue his passion with utmost sincerity and obligation to his stakeholders.\nHowever, all the success and hard work took a dramatic \nturn when Paris Bakery was forced to shut down its entire operations due to shareholders\u2019 tussle. Mr Jay was helpless in all this trauma and the market was also equally shocked with the aftermath of this drastic closure.\nWith the commencement of 2019 (Figure 4), the entire \nbusiness gradually kick-started with a newfound hope, ambition, precision marketing and omnichannel strategy. The product line-ups were few to begin with, but the plan was to increase sequentially based on latest market trends.\nPersonal Background\nMr Jay was an alumnus of National Institute of Sales, New \nDelhi. After completing PG Diploma in Sales and Marketing, he went ahead to join Shoppers Stop as \nCustomer Care Associate, then to Landmark group LLC (Dubai) as Unit Manager in ECCO brand. After that, he joined Khadims India Ltd. as Area Sales Manager and then went on to become the Relationship Manager in ICICI bank Ltd. With eagerness to formally learn more about the field and put it into practice, he did an Executive MBA \nFigure 1. Paris Bakery Timeline\nSource: The authors.\nFigure 2.

Paris Bakery was born out of intense desire and sheer determination and Mr Jay left no stone unturned to make that a household brand.\nIndustry Background\nAs breads and biscuits (a part of bakery products along with many others which is shown in Figure 5) came under the category of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), irrespective of any market slowdown, their consumption pattern did not change; rather, the sales increased. Diving deeper, the demand for bread was also continuously rising for the preparation of sandwiches, burgers, snacks and soups with the landslide growth of fast-food chains.\nIn addition, the value-addition by the different bakery \nchains was further helping its growth in the market. Consumers\u2019 busy and cosmopolitan lifestyles, influenced by Western culture, were also playing a critical role in the dramatic rise in its consumption. With a market of US$ 7.22 billion in 2018, Indian bakery industry was set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.3% from 2019 to 2024 to more than US$ 9.5 billion.\nBhubaneswar was a tier-2 city where the bakery business \nwas approximated to be worth `1,000 million annually, \nand the revenue for one unit shop of Paris Bakery was around `12 million. Hence, the opportunity for growth was \ntremendous, but there had to be a specific strategy which must cater to the lifestyle of millennials as well as generation Z (typically those who were born after 1994 and were next to enter the workforce). \nRequirements of a good bakery service experience:\n\u2022\t A\tgood\toven:\tIt\twas\tthe\tsingle\tmost\timportant\t\nequipment that could make or break your business. \nIt might be wooden or electric.\n\u2022\tBread making expertise: The ingredients were numerous such as additives like sugar, salt content, water composition, type of oil and yeast, which var -\nied for one bread from the other.\n\u2022\tFreshness: Bakery items were perishable. Hence, care had to be taken to meet the demand and not overproduce anything to prevent stale bread, soggy biscuits or old cakes.\n\u2022\tCustomer service: Survey results showed that pleased customers\u2019 conversion rate from the same store was 86% compared to less than 30% when the customers met their expectations. The primary task was to create a delighted customer experience every time they walked into the store.\nParis Bakery Business Model \nThe strategy was to adopt omnichannel and create a bakery mall for a holistic customer experience. During that period, the online sales through Zomato (exclusive tie-up all over India having a customer base of 1,500) was around `30,000 while the breakeven point was achieved at `25,000. The \noffline business was centred on a cluster model. At the heart of the cluster was a cloud kitchen which was responsible to look after five nearby offline stores located within a radius of 4\u20135 km. The establishment cost was around `400,000. Cloud kitchen was a place where cakes \nand other subsidiary items were made, kept in cold storage and delivered to the customer directly or through aggregators. The capacity of the cloud kitchen was 100 \nFigure 4.  2019 Product Portfolio\nSource: The authors.", "doc_id": "608209b9-ae03-476e-951e-3900eb3cc26d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8c58a0907dccd03694f6fb568bd0dd4c7c49b551e0799134aace012c753b19e0", "extra_info": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Omnichannel Strategy Paris bakery strat.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3541, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "2d7435b6-8186-492a-a4be-c7db87cc67d7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "029b2b6d-2231-45bc-8851-b417c8234e18": {"__data__": {"text": "4 FIIB Business Review\ncakes per day weighing 0.5 kg each and with a sales price \nof `500 including GST.\nParis bakery had a cloud kitchen which was addressing \ncater ing to five areas\u2014Ashok Nagar, KIIT, IRC Village \n(Nayapalli), Niladri Vihar and Jaydev Vihar. The \norganization wanted to expand into Khandagiri and Old Town market as well. It was to be duly noted that the cloud kitchen was supposed to be entirely set up by Paris Bakery and physical stores would be opened on a franchise basis.\nThe business model (Figure 6) was very aggressive as \nthe founder himself was visiting two cities in every 15 days. Cuttack and Puri had been covered in this approach and more such plans were in the pipeline. It was to be borne in mind that penetration strategies were the same for both the cities irrespective of their development status; that is, Cuttack and Bengaluru were given similar weightages, though Bengaluru was more developed and had more purchasing power per individual. \nThe ingredients were to remain the same, but the chefs \nwere supposed to be hired from different parts of the country when respective expansion activity was to be conducted. The idea was to maintain quality, to give a standardized look (like that of McDonald\u2019s) and, most importantly, keep the taste intact through omnichannel.\nEach physical store (owned by a franchise) would cost \nin a range of `900,000\u2013`1.1 million. The target location majorly targeted locations with a substantial Odia community was the target market for Paris Bakery.  \nThe segmentation of the next target markets was already finalized; they were Bengaluru, Sura, and Nagpur. With the tie-up with Zomato, team Paris Bakery was optimistic to make it big at the national level through strategic penetration and aggressive marketing and by opening of more stores in and outside Odisha. \nRunning Cost of a Store  \n(per Month)\nSince all the stores were operating in Bhubaneswar, the \nrent amount was `10,000, electrical cost (fridge, deep fridge and other machineries) was `10,000, salary of staffs (2 people employed\u2014chef and helper) was `25,000 and miscellaneous was taken as `5,000. Hence, the net fixed cost in a physical store was `50,000 per month which amounted to `1,700 per day (approximation).\nThe production capacity was previously mentioned as \n100 cakes per day and the revenue generated was ` 50,000. \nThe raw material cost (cost of goods sold [COGS]) was one-third of revenue which amounted to ` 17,000. Packaging cost \nwas 7%, of total which was ` 3,500 (per cake ` 35). Zomato \nused to give discount coupons which came under marketing and promotional activities that amounted to ` 50 a cake or \nFigure 5.

The entire amount \nprojected was ` 27,200, with 16% coming from cooking, \n10% from bread, 7% from snacks and the rest amount \ncollected was from packaging and gifts.\nA physical store (cloud kitchen  shown in Figure 7) used \nto sell final products approximately worth `70,000 per day. Avoiding risk, the profit margin was more than 250%, which signified the importance of the niche segment that Paris Bakery had focused on and why there had to be a concrete IT strategy to go national and maintain customer satisfaction.\nParis Bakery was the first bakery in India with an \nadvance model framework (Figure 8) (in terms of inventory management) which was re-engineered in such a way that the complete payment of the advance amount (no credit purchase) was taken before delivery of the final product. The cloud kitchen was taking cake of the order from online and offline sources, keeping a track of the entire order list. The order was taken 1 day prior and the required product was made by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). After that, the packaged food was sold in the cloud kitchen from 8 a.m. onwards for take away delivery or from 10 a.m. onwards through Zomato delivery executives. The delivery was made immediately in order to bring down the staleness of cakes.\nThere was a wallet system (payment gateway) where all \nmonetary transactions were taking place. The loyalty programme points were there in the form of coupons which were yet to be converted to monetary value. Mr Jay had the plan in place to monetize those coupons within next 3 months of operation.\nThe City: Bhubaneswar\nBhubaneswar, where the bakery had its operations, was \ngrowing; as per the CII report (2019), the number of industries had grown by 17%, while the urban area had expanded to cover 23% more area. These areas were from nearby downtowns, which had been declared as part of Bhubaneswar Municipality Corporation (BMC notification, March 2016). In addition, the telecommunication and Internet network witnessed an increase of more towers being built around the city for improving connectivity across the city. This, in addition to building new state highways and repairing existing internal roads, has improved mobility, transport of goods and transporting facilities. Here, the role of both state and central governments was laudable.\nIssues at Hand\nThere were three issues that bothered the organization which were niche market, low investment and risk management. Since that was a niche market, other big \nFigure 6.

Low investment was prone to many newcomers who, by seeing the profit, would jump to do this business and would reduce the revenue over a period of years. Food and bakery industries were very volatile in nature. Hence, staff movement among franchises for career growth was a common issue, but those things affected the business flow significantly because sometimes customers\u2019 basket was taken care of based on that person\u2019s recommendation, which resulted in a potential customer loss. Hence, care had to be taken to make the brand vibrant enough so that it did not have any human interference.\nShifting to Omnichannel\nThe strategy proposed by Omnichannel (Niels et al., 2008) and (Mohapatra & Sahu, 2018) (Figure 9) could be defined \nas the seamless integration of both online and physical stores \nfor a customer friendly shopping experience. It was the product characteristics and consumer needs that forced organizations to implement that strategy to gain a significant edge over competitors. Since the demand for bakery products could be easily predictable and it had low uncertainty, omnichannel was the best fit for Paris Bakery. However, omnichannel was fully not advisable at that point of time because of the information complexity (Mohapatra, 2017). Also, the organization was in its initial phase of growth. Hence, there were challenges to integrate this strategy.\nOmnichannel strategy was being used to collect data \nfrom both online (aggregators are included) and offline channels which helped Paris Bakery do the predictive and prescriptive analysis for its business growth. The data helped in feedback-based product development, service optimization, delivery and to get more satisfied customers.\nOnline points of interaction for customers were desktops, \nmobiles (mobile commerce [m-commerce]) and aggregators. Bots (robots) or chatbots which were programmed with predefined data sets or FAQs to answer customers\u2019 query instantly and Internet of Things (IOT) were the technologies and tools which gathered the digital traces left by customers after every bit of interaction and transaction. The data, thus, collected from search, choose, compare, ordering pattern, discount per order, payment and reward points were  \nanalysed to serve customers better, identify future business opportunities and optimize supply chain cost.\nBots (robots) were implemented in customer care for \nquick query addressal and instant feedback which helped measure customer satisfaction index (CSI) that measured quality, price, theme, trendiness of products as well as store ambience, online payment and food delivery experience.\nIOT was used for temperature control (inside store and \ndelivery box), moisture control, maintaining hygiene in the supply chain and click-through rate (CTR) (CTR was the ratio of users engaged with a link to the total users who viewed that link) for location-based marketing strategy and market promotion.\nData were also collected from physical stores in terms \nof take away orders, payment and feedback register to add value to customer service.\nAlso, webrooming (Webrooming is looking at the \nproduct on Internet and buying it in a physical store) and showrooming (Showrooming is looking at the product in the physical store and then buying online) behaviours were studied to understand how customer behaviour was ", "doc_id": "4c05c730-a6ee-4d20-9dd1-d840747825d4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c42eeebc1fd40ad74bdfc0ed2a647ee05e2e919a4f92951a81806f42c29abe00", "extra_info": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Omnichannel Strategy Paris bakery strat.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3604, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b6b4731e-90c8-4abf-8004-f37d2c13c78f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b808bcf1-af34-442a-9c79-3b5aab921bde": {"__data__": {"text": "Mohapatra and Das 7\nchanging with respect to digital transformation (Jensen, \n2002). Looking at the multiple shopping habits adopted by consumers, it was concluded that an omnichannel strategy was deemed fit not only for faster expansion but also for maximum control of day-to-day business operations with a dashboard. Per day revenue, as of September 21 2019 per store was `40,000 and aggregating it for five stores amounted to net revenue at `200,000. The break-even cost \nof streamlining the entire business operations to suit multichannel shopping, shifting the technology base and database to cloud was achieved within 10 months. With this implementation, the customer visit to the store and website (both personal computer and mobile devices included) increased by 120% and 408%, respectively. The \nstore visit was significantly increased going by the \nstandards of customer behaviour. However, the online visit had more room for improvement.Cloud Adoption\nThe cloud service adopted was Software-as-a-Service \n(SaaS) which costed `420,000 in the first month and up to `50,000 from next month onwards based on the historical data gathered by the cloud provider. The amount was a ballpark figure considering the earlier mode of expansion strategy which was based on pay-as\u2013you-go service model such as CPU utilization, number of requests per second, storage and additional load.

He also had the assurance of the cloud provider that no data will be lost in this migration process. For this, a pilot plan was rolled out and after the success, complete migration was done. The IT head of Paris Bakery took notice of this cognizance and again reassured the founder that the culture and work practices would not  \nbe changed with this transition process. Additionally, the expansion model was designed to integrate all the futuristic technologies without much fuss to the customer experience. \nSuggestions for Near Future\nIOT, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), bot \n(robot), Beacon technology, touchless commerce (scans basket, prepares invoice and selfie payment), Predictive and Prescriptive analysis were some of the suggestions, in terms of technology, given to the senior management to make the business relevant, profitable and competitive; achieve a higher market share; become customer-centric for the future generations of shoppers. As we all were moving towards a more connected world, the possibilities and opportunities were more than ever before. \nThe competitive business model, that was paying off, also \nforced Paris bakery to invest in R&D but the more sustainable model was being collaborative, that is, to create an ecosystem taking all the stakeholders (including competitors) into consideration and to become a leading bakery service provider in India. From the research by Clever, a Fintech company, it was reported that 28% millennials purchased products due to social media influence. Hence digital marketing had to be customized and personalized.\nm-Commerce was going to play a pivotal role with \nexpected market revenue of `2,660 billion by 2020. Hence, mobile applications had to be there for easy transactions. Every customer was unique; therefore, personalization of cakes or bakery products by taking into consideration the past purchasing behaviour of that particular customer would significantly boost the brand value among the millennials as well as generation Z.\nThe management did delve into webrooming and \nshowrooming behaviour of customers and implemented click and collect model at the earliest while understanding \nthe young and tech savvy customers.\nThe cash-rich consumers who were time-starved were \nready to pay for the convenience; hence, maintaining quality of the brand was of utmost importance for Paris Bakery. \nAbbreviations\nAI Artificial Intelligence\nAR Augmented reality\nBLE Bluetooth Low Energy\nC2B consumer-to-business\nCAGR compound annual growth rate\nCOGS cost of goods sold\nCPU central processing unit\nCTR click-through rate\nGPS Global Positioning System\nGST Goods and Services Tax\nINR Indian rupee (`)\nIOT Internet of Things\nIT information technology\nm-Commerce mobile commerce\nOEM original equipment manufacturer\nR&D research and development\nUSP unique selling propositions\nVR virtual reality\nDisclaimer\nThis case is written solely for educational purposes and is not \nintended to represent successful or unsuccessful managerial decision making.

As a \nresult, the industry has become increasingly competitive, with both local and international \ncompanies vying for a share of the market.  \nOne of the key drivers of growth in the bakery sector has been the increasing popularity \nof convenience stores and supermarkets, which have made it easier for consumers to \npurchase baked goods on the go. In addition, the rise of online shopping has also \ncontributed to the growth of the industry, as consumers can now easily order baked goods \nfrom the comfort of their own homes.  \nDespite the growth of the sector, the market is still dominated by small, independent \nbakeries. These bakeries often offer a wide range of traditional Thai baked goods, such \nas sweet and savory pastries and breads, as well as more Western -style products su ch \nas cookies and cakes. In recent years, however, there has been a rise in the number of \nlarger, more specialized bakeries, which focus on particular types of baked goods, such \nas artisanal breads or gourmet desserts.  \nOne of the key challenges facing the bakery sector is the increasing cost of ingredients, \nparticularly flour and sugar. As a result, many bakeries have had to raise prices in order \nto remain profitable. In addition, the industry is also facing increasing c ompetition from \nother snack food options, such as street food and fast food, which can be cheaper and \nmore convenient for consumers.  \nDespite these challenges, the bakery sector in Thailand remains strong, with many \nconsumers still viewing baked goods as an important part of their daily diets.

Thailand was equal to 150.00 million USD \n(calculated in retail prices) in 2015. Until 2025, the biscuits and crackers market in \nThailand is forecast to reach 235.85 million USD (in retail prices), thus increasing at \na CA GR of 2.55% per annum for the period 2020 -2024. This is a decrease, \ncompared to the growth of about 7.19% per year, registered in 2015 -2019 . \nThe average consumption per capita in value terms reached 2.19 USD per capita (in \nretail prices) in 2015. In the next five years, it grew at a CAGR of 6.90% per annum. \nIn the medium term (by 2025), the indicator is forecast to slow down its growth and \nincrease at a CAGR of 2.33% per annum . \nAs an overall, the market for most bread and bakery products is projected to \ncontinue its positive trend. Consumers are increasingly looking towards healthier \noptions for an improved lifestyle. Following this trend people are expected to want to \ncut back o n the sugar in their baked goods, which will increase demand for savory \nbaked goods in the next couple of years. With the continuing shift from sugar heavy \ncategories, companies are also expected to begin offering less -sugar heavy \ncategories such as cracke rs and savory snacks to counteract concerns over sugar. \nAccording to industry experts, the category of savory biscuits is projected to \nsignificantly rise in the medium term, compared to sweet biscuits, the sales of which \nare expected to stagnate. At the sa me time, however, the sweet baked goods are a \ncategory that offers opportunities for innovation. Bakeries are expected to use more \nnatural sources of sugar in their products or sweeteners like chicory root fiber and \ncorn starch -sourced fiber . \nConsumers are increasingly looking towards healthier options for an improved \nlifestyle. Following this trend people are expected to want to cut back on the sugar in \nconfectionery, which will increase demand for savory goods in the next couple of \nyears. In comparison, the sales of confectionery products are expected to stagnate. \nSome people have already completely withdrawn sweets from their diets due to the \nhigh sugar levels they contain along with other preservatives. Therefore, people are \nexpected to subs titute consumption of confectionery products with more fruits and \nnuts. With the continuing shift from sugar heavy categories, companies are also \nexpected to begin offering less -sugar heavy categories such as crackers and savory \nsnacks to counteract concer ns over sugar.

the la ndscape two decades ago \nwhen it was considered much smaller and less developed compared with other markets \nin the region.  Rice and noodles remain st aple food for the average Thai household; but \nbread, pastry or cookies can usually be found in the snack corner in many homes.  Business executives and many office workers in Bangkok and other urban areas have a \nbite of a sandwich or bun or croissant or even donut with their coffee for breakfast \u2013 \neither in a coffee shop or purchased \u2018on- the-go.\u2019  On weekends, shopping malls are \npacked with people of all ages to enjoy the cool atmosphere, the pleasure of shopping, \nand dining out with family and friends \u2013 at a wide selection of restaurants, bakery shops \nand donut outlets.  Not only do they eat on the premises, they usually also buy a bag of \nbaked goods to take home.   From the small-scale bakery operation of th e past, the industry now has more than 700 \nmedium-sized and large businesses with nearly 14,000 locations/outlets nationwide including:   \n\uf0b7 Industrial bakeries  \n\uf0b7 Retail bakery chains, including local, regional and international \n\uf0b7 Caf\u00e9 chains \n\uf0b7 Other retail concepts, e.g. donu t outlets and pizza outlets  \n\uf0b7 In-store bakeries in supermarkets and hypermarkets \n\uf0b7 Bake-off shops in convenience stores \n\uf0b7 In-house bake shops in hotels \n In addition, several thousands of small ba keries, home-based entrepreneurs and \nartisanal bakeries do still exist and there is  a positive trend towards these upgrading and, \nin some cases, evolving into higher grade single site caf\u00e9 bakery or standalone bakery \noutlets.    In Europe and Northern America, many busi ness mergers and acquisitions in the bakery \nsector have transpired over the past decade, in order to achieve economies of scale. In \nThailand, only one or two M&A deals have been formed in recent years, e.g., the  \nacquisition of Au Bon Pain and Dunkin\u2019 Donu ts franchises in Thailand in 2012 from \nNavis Capital by Sub Sri Thai  PLC (SST)\u2013 a public company listed on the Stock Exchange \nof Thailand with interests in warehousing, log istics and edible oil.  Thus the market is \nstill highly-fragmented with no new co nsolidations seen on the horizon.  \n   ", "doc_id": "52e712e7-bc7f-40ec-b215-b356c8ac6b66", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d05fac721a5bc25486c44e66819c76def3051db89e5471f820af91ea621be84c", "extra_info": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Thai Bakery Business Opportunity.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2314, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "f62728c7-35f3-4c9f-ab18-3d509b977394"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9348eb2-1204-43c3-a4a4-79c50160289a": {"__data__": {"text": " \nPAGE 7 \n 2 Market size and growth trends       \n                      Unit: billion baht \nBaked goods \nIn 2012 the Thai baked goods market was estimated to be worth nearly 27 billion baht\n1.    \n According to leading players the market grew at least 10 percent per year during th e past few years and will \ncontinue to enjoy annual doub le digit growth of 10-15 \npercent in the short to medium term as a result of increasing number of in-store bakery shops and retail outlets.            \n \n2012 Market = 27 Billion Baht \n          Source: Industry &trade interviews; Commerce Ministry \n \nBy product category, the market can be broken  down into bread, 40 percent; pastry, 24 \npercent; cake, 19 percent; donuts, 11 percen t; and cookies & biscuits, 5 percent.  \n By type of outlet, retail bakery chains accou nted for the highest share at 35 percent, \nfollowed by convenience stores, 33 percent; in-store bakeries at hypermarkets, 16 \npercent; in-house bake shops at hotels, 9 per cent; and artisanal & home-based bakers, 7 \npercent.   \n \nType\u00a0of\u00a0outlet\u00a0 Players\u00a02012\u00a0\u00a0\n(Million\u00a0\nBaht)\u00a0Market\u00a0\nShare\u00a0\nRetail\u00a0bakery\u00a0chains\u00a0\n(including \u00a0donut\u00a0&\u00a0\ncoffee\u00a0chains)\u00a0S&P,\u00a0Yamazaki, \u00a0Au\u00a0Bon\u00a0\nPain,\u00a0BreadTalk, \u00a0\nGateaux\u00a0House,\u00a0Mr.\u00a0\nDonuts,\u00a0Dunkin'\u00a0Donuts,\u00a0\netc.\u00a09.397\u00a0 35%\u00a0\nConvenience \u00a0stores\u00a07\u201011,\u00a0Family\u00a0Mart,\u00a0108\u00a0\nShop\u00a08.920\u00a0 33%\u00a0\nHypermarkets \u00a0Big\u00a0C,\u00a0Tesco\u00a0Lotus,\u00a0\nMakro\u00a04.300\u00a0 16%\u00a0\nHotels\u00a0 500\u00a0luxury\u00a0hotels\u00a0 2.373\u00a0 9%\u00a0\nArtisanal\u00a0&\u00a0home\u2010\nbased\u00a0bakers\u00a0Several\u00a0thousands \u00a0 2.000\u00a0 7%\u00a0\nTotal\u00a0 26.989\u00a0 100%\u00a0\n \n                                                                          \n1Mid-rate in 2012: 1 EUR = THB39.96 \nhttp://www2.bot.or.th/statistics/ReportP age.aspx?reportID=123&language=eng \n", "doc_id": "e9348eb2-1204-43c3-a4a4-79c50160289a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0fe112e30085483f5570ff23a58ca6ff507ec0354841fcc107a189523a80bca5", "extra_info": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Thai Bakery Business Opportunity.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1692, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "c290360a-6801-4a77-bd1b-106843d7a859"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "76cf18c3-a34f-4949-a0a5-11e160b283d7": {"__data__": {"text": " \nPAGE 8 \n Source: Group estimate of a leading hypermarket, edible oil producer, bakery ingredient su pplier and Larive \u2013  based on \ncompany sales submitted to the Ministry of Commerce \n \nBy manufacturer, packaged bread producer  President Bakery Public Co., Ltd. \ncommanded the largest share in the 27 billi on baht baked goods market in 2012 with an \nestimated 21.6 percent contribution, followed  by CPRAM with 18.9 percent share, and \nS&P Syndicate Public Co., Ltd. with 10.6 percent share of the market.

Th e company possesses key strengths, with its \nlong-standing presence in Thailand, strong distr ibution network nationwide and a large \nvariety of products across different categories. Its larger scale of production helps the \ncompany to obtain economy of scale, whil st its products are standa rdized in terms of \nquality compared to independent unpackaged / artisanal bakeries.  President Bakery\u2019s \nproduct portfolio ranges from sliced br ead, burger/hotdog buns, snack bread, snack \ncakes, cookies and pies. In 2012, the compa ny invested more in new machinery to \nincrease the production capacity of  its packaged/industrial bread line. \n Second-ranked CPRAM manufactures and distr ibutes frozen food, prepared food, chilled \nfood and bakery products both for the local and international markets.  Sales split is \nabout 85 percent domestic and 15 percent ex port.  Current production capacity is 1.8 \nmillion pieces of dim sum, 280,000 packs of ready meals and 1.4 million bakery items \nper day.  Bakery items are distributed through  modern trade outlets including its sibling \ncompany\u2019s 7-Eleven convenience store chain, retail stores in gas stations, hypermarkets \nand supermarkets.  CPRAM\u2019s sales of baked goods reached an estimated 5 billion baht last year or 18.5 percent share of the market.   From a very small family-run operation in 19 73, S&P has transformed after four decades \ninto a multi-billion baht bakery and food service business that serves the whole of \nThailand and a number of overseas ma rkets including Singapore, Taiwan, China, \nSwitzerland and the U.K.  S&P and its su bsidiaries operate business related to \nrestaurants, coffee and beverages, bakery, and ready to eat food, and produce various \nfood products under the name S&P.  The bakery business accounts for about 50 percent of the company\u2019s domestic revenues.  Th e company\u2019s local operation has enjoyed \ndouble-digit growth over the past 5-6 years, with CAGR of 11.4%.  Domestic sales in 2012 stood at 5,663 million baht, with sales of  baked goods worth 2,850 million baht \u2013 \nmaking S&P the third largest player in the retail bakery market with nearly 11 percent \nshare.   Bakery ingredients The biggest supplier of bakery ingredie nts is Kim Chua Group Co., Ltd. (KCG), with \ndomestic sales worth 4 billion baht in 2012 or about 37 percent of the ingredients \nmarket. Perceived by competitors as a ma ss (low-end) supplier, KCG carries a broad \nproduct range, with the bulk of sales derived from blended butter and margarine.   United Flour Mill Plc, the largest producer of milled flour in the country and the biggest supplier to the bakery industry achieved sales estimated at 3.6 billi on baht in 2012, of \nwhich at least 50 percent came from bakery, for a market share of between 15 to 20 \npercent in the ingredients segment.

Thailand is self-sufficient for granu lated sugar and fat (butter / margarine \n/ shortening); but there are still some imports of these products.

Except for some stainless steel cabinets and \nrefrigerating equipment, practically all types  of large and small bakery equipment \nused in the country are imported.  Ma jor importers carry a broad range of \ncommercial kitchen & bakery equipment including various types of oven \n(convection ovens, deck ovens, conveyor pi zza ovens, wood-fired ovens), proofers, \ndough sheeters/cutting/ & make up line , mixers, donut fryers, hot bake shop \nmachinery, and bread sli cers/dividers/and rounders.  \n \nDespite the emerging presence in Thai land of equipment made in China, the \nmajority of industrial and retail baker ch ains still prefer large equipment made in \nEurope \u2013 perceived as reliable,  durable and highly-efficient.  Expansion of in-store \nbakeries in discount stores and supermarke ts presents a promising upward trend in \ndemand for baking equipment.  Moreover, the rising trend of bake-off concept in \nconvenience store outlets, e.g., 7-Eleven\u2019s  Kudsan Bakery & Coffee, will drive the \nneed for more ovens and baking utensils. \n \n\u2012 Import of hi-tech packaging solutions.  There is a niche demand for imported \nspecialty flexible packaging solutions used for desserts such as moon cakes that need a special oxygen barrier film to keep the product fresh for weeks without \nadding preservatives to the product. \n \n\u2012 Others.  In addition to imports of products cite d above, the bakery sector offers a \nrange of other opportunities, for instance in  services (e.g., training, education) and \nIT solutions.  At present there is shortage of skilled manpower in  the sector because \nnew graduates prefer managing their ow n business rather than working in hotels \nand restaurants.  A solution could be trai ning people that have the interest, but lack \nproper educational background, in bakery sc hools and training centers outside the \nacademic system.   \n \nSeamless interaction of production processes in the bakery industry is crucial \u2013 and \nan IT solution such as integrated automation system for bakery production processes could be the answer.

The Thai bakery industry mainly imports premixes, cake \nmixes and other flour mixes from overseas  suppliers.  This market is worth about \none billion baht per year.  There is a per ceived business opportunity for setting up a \nblending operation in Thailand to serve not only the domestic market but the whole \nof ASEAN.  Trading between ASEAN countries is highly conducive because of zero \ntariffs on commodities traded between member nations.  The blending factory \ncould also potentially receive tax and o ther location-based incentives from the \ngovernment\u2019s Board of Investment (BOI) as this falls under the List of Activities \nEligible for BOI Promotion.   \n \n\u2012 Retail Bakery Franchising.  The success of retail chains in Thailand\u2019s bakery \nlandscape has been exceptional, from home  grown entrepreneurs such as S&P and \nCoffee Beans by Dao, to regional players su ch as Thai Yamazaki, BreadTalk and \nSecret Recipe, and global businesses such as the donut chains.   Underlying growth \nof these players combined was in double di gits over the past five years and is \nexpected to continue in the medium term.  Thus there are vast opportunities for \nretail bakery franchising.  Important pointers for potential investors include: first and foremost \u2013 location; second, smart choice of bakery delights that appeal to local consumers and expat community; a nd third, ability to find competent and \nloyal employees. \n \nWe expect the Thai market to be receptive for typical Dutch franchise concepts like \n\u2018het Stoepje,\u2019 \u2018Bakker Bart\u2019 and others. \n \n\u2012 Regional Operating Headquarters.  With its highly strateg ic location in Asia, \nThailand is in the best position for glob al companies to set up their Regional \nOperating Headquarters (ROH).  Compared  with Singapore and Hong Kong, the cost \nof doing business in Thailand is still much  cheaper.  The country offers modern \ninfrastructure and reasonably skilled labor force.  In addition, ROH is a government \npromoted activity which gets attractive ta x and non-tax incentive package from the \nBOI.  \n   6 Key elements of success for Dutch traders \n \n\u2012 Education.  The Thai bakery sector is relatively young and buyers tend to be hesitant \nto change their buying behavior. Suppliers are advised to give high emphasis to \neducation in their marketing mix.

The analysis contains a \nreview of the basic components of the  Thai bakery industry which are: \n \n\u2012 Market identification  \n\u2012 Market size estimation, market shares, growth trends \n\u2012 Business cycle \n\u2012 Product niche \n\u2012 Growth potential (discussed under each section below) \n\u2012 Competition  (discussed in a separate chapter) \n The analysis is aimed at helping companie s determine if they can successfully enter \nthe Thai bakery market and generate en ough profits to advance their business \noperations.   The market size estimates are not precise but indicative of the current \nmarket situation.    \nA. Market identification  \nBaked goods are consumed by practically al l Thai consumers of all ages, but are \npredominantly popular among the working population in urban areas such as Bangkok and vicinities and major cities.     Bakery ingredients are used by all types of bakeries; but higher grade ingredients \n(e.g., imported butter, cocoa powder, chocolat es) are used by hotels and specialist \nbakeries; while thousands of smaller bakeri es that dot the country mainly use edible \noil and fats, and locally milled flour.  Top-end customers such as President Bakery, manufacturer of Farmhouse bread products and Thai Airways Catering use first-class \nquality imported wheat flour (e.g., from  Dossche Mills), although the bread maker \nalso buys from domestic wheat flour suppliers.   Industrial bakeries use automated bakery machinery; while artisanal bakeries use \nsmaller bakery equipment.  \n B.

The e stimated demand split between local and \nimported is about 80%:20% by value and 85%:15% by volume. \n \nIn bread making, about 2 to 5 kg of yeast is used for every 100 kg of wheat flour.  By \nvalue, the ratio of wheat flour to yeast is approximately 87%:13% - which translates \nto about 420 million baht worth of yeast used  in 2012.

Taking  Mr.Donu ts\u2019 case again, the Japanese franchise \noperator Duskin Company which covers Asia including Thailand,  has recently announced that it would substantially change its donut recipes \u2013 the first \nmajor change since 1971 when the chain de buted in Japan.  Duskin said it will \nalter the recipe for dough and will use oi l it has originally developed to make \nits donuts tastier.   New products started  selling in Japan on April 26, 2013 \nwithout changing their prices.  Duskin is expected to extend the recipe change \nshortly to its franchisees in Thailand.   This could be a golden opportunity for \nan ingredient supplier to work with Central Restaurants Group. \n \nD. Product niche \nIn relation to market size assessment and business cycle that have already been discussed, companies should develop bakery  products that meet a specific niche in \nthe market.  Products must be differentiated from others in the market so they meet \na specific need of consumer demand, creating higher demand for their product.    For instance, industrial bread producer Pr esident Bakery offers new products each \nyear and conducts tests in sample markets to determine which of their potential \nproduct styles is most preferred by consumer s.  Also the company aims to develop its \nbakery products so that competitors canno t easily duplicate their product \u2013 \nalthough this has become very challenging for President Bakery because being the market leader, its products are being \u2018copied\u2019 left and right, with some changes in \nminor ingredients or proportions of sugar or milk or shortening.    Product positioning is very much related to creating a market niche.  Mr. Donuts and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts sold at affordable prices both appeal to the youn ger generation that \nhave modest purchasing power.  On the other hand, higher-end products of Krispy \nKreme are more pricey and targeted for more affluent consumers.

The landscape of Thailand\u2019s bakery industry s eems to be a contradiction of marketing \ntheory.   Since there is a country-wide proliferation of bakery outlets of all sizes, one \nwould expect that the market is nearing its saturation level and maturity where fewer \nprofits are achieved and companies will begin to lose money.  But the exact opposite is \ntrue. Despite the seemingly overcrowded spac e, evident especially in Bangkok and its \nvicinities, and in urban areas, there is an observed burgeoning demand of Thai \nconsumers for bread or a sandwich at breakfast or a piece of cake or savory during coffee \nbreak.  Henceforth the market continues to embrace new players particularly the ones \nwho can offer innovative and novel bakery products at affordable prices and sold at convenient locations.  Overall packaged bread pr oducer President Bakery Public Co., Ltd. commanded the \nlargest share in the 27 billion baht ba ked goods market in 2012 with 21.6 percent \ncontribution (THB5.82 billion sales from ba ked goods for domestic market).  Coming a \nclose second is CP Retailing & Marketing (CPRAM ) which is the manufacturing arm of CP \nAll, franchise operator of 7-Eleven convenience stores, with approximately THB5 billion \nsales of baked goods or 18.9 percent sha re. The third biggest manufacturer, S&P \nSyndicate Public Co., Ltd. which specializes in  cakes more than bread, had 10.6 percent \nshare of the market.  The othe r ranked players were the g lobal hypermarket/cash & carry \ngiants Siam Makro and Tesco Lotus, each ha ving 5.6 percent share, and Big C with 4.8 \npercent.  Together, these six players contr ibuted more than two-thirds of baked goods \nsales in 2012, while the othe r retail bakery chains, coffee chains, artisanal bakeries and \nhome-based bakers accounted for the rest, with a value of approximately 9 billion baht.  \n \nCompany \u00a02012\u00a0Sales\u00a0\n(Billion\u00a0\nBaht)3\u00a0%\u00a0Share\u00a0\nPresident \u00a0Bakery\u00a0 5.82\u00a0 21.6%\u00a0\nCPRAM\u00a0 5.00\u00a0 18.5%\u00a0\nS&P\u00a0 2.85\u00a0 10.6%\u00a0\nSiam\u00a0Makro\u00a0 1.50\u00a0 5.6%\u00a0\nTesco\u00a0Lotus\u00a0 1.50\u00a0 5.6%\u00a0\nBig\u00a0C\u00a0 1.30\u00a0 4.8%\u00a0\nOthers\u00a0 9.02\u00a0 33.4%\u00a0\nTotal\u00a0 26.99\u00a0 100.0%\u00a0\n  Source: Annual reports, interviews, news reports and Larive estimates \n \n  \n                                                                          \n3Mid-rate in 2012: 1 EUR = THB39.96 \nhttp://www2.bot.or.th/statistics/ReportP age.aspx?reportID=123&language=eng  ", "doc_id": "473a5f16-7e17-4a02-b9a3-2a663318bed9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b945be805428a6f1497894409ca8f04556167dfb7e086d97983dc2243a296cfe", "extra_info": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Thai Bakery Business Opportunity.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2595, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "7e069fb8-5a47-476b-a941-371059f9517b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b373d8ce-f458-4975-baa7-9c46312b86c9": {"__data__": {"text": "[GEEF TEKST OP]  \n \nPAGE 38 \n 1 RETAIL BAKERY CHAINS \n \nThais are known to be willing to try and taste new and innovative products.

In April 2006, Royal \nABP Thailand became ABP Cafe Thailand, jointl y owned by the Narula family and Navis \nCapital.   Five years later in November 20 11, the company was bought out by Sub Sri Thai \n(SST), a warehouse service provider and the prod ucer of Tip brand edible oil.  To ensure \nuninterrupted operation, SST had retained the then existing management team of Au \nBon Pain.

For \ndecades, the two American giants compet ed fiercely for market share, with both \nclaiming pole position.      Tapping the huge demand in the donut crazy nation, Krispy Kreme became the third U.S \ndonut franchise operator to join its big brothers in 2010.    Before Krispy Kreme came into the pict ure, two local players Do Dee Dough and Daddy \nDough started their own donut chains.  In addition, there are numerous independent Thai shops that proliferate in supermarkets and shopping malls.    \nBeing the pioneer in Thailand, Mister Donut ha s been a leader in the Thai donut market \nsince 1978. It is known for its concept \"Don ut for Fun.\" Operated by franchise holder \nCentral Restaurants Group, Mister Donut has 280 branches across Thailand with more \nopening yearly. They include stand-alone stores as well as outlets at shopping malls and \nsupermarkets.   To gain and maintain marke t share, Mister Donut has launched price-\ncutting strategy with a bit smaller portion of i ts donuts and sold at cheaper prices than \nDunkin\u2019 Donuts.  The strategy is working as Mister Donut has continued to command \nthe biggest share of the ever growing marke t.  But the presence of Krispy Kreme and \nDaddy Dough has eaten away some shares fr om both Mr. Donut and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.

For the other bakery ingredients, the \ncountry is highly dependent on imports, whic h creates vast opportu nities for foreign-\nbased manufacturers to supply the market.   \nThere is great potential to sell high-grade in gredients to hotels.  For instance, Anantara \nBakery of the hotel chain uses only high  quality ingredients imported from Europe and \nthe U.S. for making breads, cakes and pastries for distribution to the food service and \ncatering sectors.  Luxury hotels with in-house  bake shop number about 500 in Thailand; \nand they make freshly baked br ead and bakery products dail y for serving guests, retail \nsale and / or delivery to outside customers. \n \nTo be acceptable to bakers, \u2018new\u2019 ingred ients, or new brand of ingredients needs to \nundergo a lengthy process of product testi ng.  Normally the ingredient needs to be \ntested at the client\u2019s R&D lab  where all product quality te sts and analyses are conducted. \nThe process may take months and even a year but the end-result can be rewarding. The \nbrand (supplier) will be a trusted partner foreve r.  While product quality is the number \none criterion in selecting a new supplier or br and, price is also a key factor in the final \nevaluation.  Thus the new product will have  to pass the product quality standards and \nalso be competitive with other bra nds available in the market.    \n \nWheat and wheat flour While the bakery sector mainly  uses locally-milled flour, the  basic raw material which is \nwheat, is all imported. At present, wheat expor ts into Thailand originate mostly from the \nU.S., Australia, and Canada which have been  the country\u2019s long-term trading partners \nfor wheat.  Opportunities for other countries to export wheat into the country are low.   \n On the other hand, Thailand still has to import wheat flour because existing production \nvolumes do not fully meet local demand.  So me 200,000 to 250,0 00 tons of wheat flour \nare imported each year worth 3 to 3.5 billion baht.  In the bakery sector, medium to \nhigh-grade types of wheat flour are importe d from the U.K. U.S.A., Russian Federation \nand Europe (e.g., Belgium, Germany, Fran ce, Italy, Ukraine).  Leading industrial \nbakeries, hotels and catering companies look  for high quality wheat flour used in \nvarious applications such as bread, pastries, and cream fillings.  This is clearly an \nopportunity for wheat flour producers overseas.

The business is \nworth more than 9 billion baht per year and sti ll growing.  In fact, retail bakery chains \nare the fastest growing segment in Thailand\u2019s bakery sector today. \n Krispy Kreme, the donut franchise from the U.S., is the most recent franchise operator that entered Thailand\u2019s bakery industry in 2010.  Sales in 2011 registered more than \nthree-fold increase over the init ial year of operation; whereas  net profit grew more than \nfour times.  At present Krispy Kreme has seve n stores in Bangkok, and has plans to open \nmore branches each year \u2013 in line with the parent company\u2019s global strategy to nearly \ndouble the number of international stores from 460 to 900 by the year 2017.    \n Why is this strategy working?    \n \n\u201cYou give credit to the brand. Where we go people  are lined up to be there. It\u2019s amazing. You \nwouldn\u2019t think Thailand would even be aware of  it, but for many weeks there was always a line \nat that shop. When you look at the potential in  places like China and India, it\u2019s pretty enormous. \nIt\u2019s kind of exciting to see that even though it\u2019s the biggest part of who we are, it\u2019s nowhere near \na mature stage.

Chose n locations or territories should support a \nretail franchise.  Some competition is fine, but not too much.  \n\u2012 Second aspect is smart choice of bakery delights.

A survey of consumer taste s and preferences would be useful. \n \n\u2012 Another important aspect is the employment fa ctor.

Food processing, packaging, food control a nd logistics are all important \nareas for possible future cooperation.  This could well be extended to the bakery industry \nwhich is constantly looking for innovative and creative products to attract a huge \ncustomer base.  \n \nFor these kinds of cooperation, the Dutch go vernment provides subsidies to both Dutch \ncompany and its local (Thai) partner.

Now a day, increasing of \ncompetitive business environment, realize consumer behaviour is the key to success. \nMarketers should understand the factor that influence consumers' purchasing behavior \nand the marketing stimulus for their products.

Paul Singh, 2020; Wikipedia, 2020; John Smith; 2020)\nMost of ingredient of bakery it come from flour, liquid, and leavening agents which \nresponsible for the characteristic appearance, texture, and flavor of bakery products. \nMilk, eggs, sugar, salt, shortening, and fat etc., are effective in modifying all qualities.\n(R. Paul Singh, 2020; .\n2.2.Consumer Buying Behavior\nAs Blackwell, Miniard and Engal (2013) said consumer behaviour consists of \nthe activities that consumers receive and are offered, products and services.\nIn the business sector, the bakery is one of the largest in the industry. It \ncomprises about 63,000 companies with approximately 41.5 million consumers in 2014 \n(ITPC, 2015), which is considered a food business. In addition, the environment of \ncompetition becomes more intense every day due to the market expansion. There are \nvarious competitors such as convenience store, supermarkets, coffee shops, traditional \nstores, bars, and more. However, more demand for food consumers (Gustavo, Viviane, \nand Luiz R. C. M, 2015; Nikolas and Anestis, 2017) encourages bakery businesses to \ndevelop improvement processes. Because it leads to diversity of consumer behaviour ", "doc_id": "d81d27a6-b465-4d2b-bc8a-dd86c4d5c3ba", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ea09ceb33d89bb2a58666e8e9cb3be481cabc318cd6bf7b27d59571451a3c61f", "extra_info": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Marketing_and_Socio-Psychological_Factors_Influenc.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2779, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "0008324d-aeaf-449a-b475-c807835c09c4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "225529ce-4330-42cc-9c53-3843b65bbdf6": {"__data__": {"text": "    \nStudies in Business and Economics no. 17(1)/2022\n- 258 -(Grillo, 2014; Jung, 2014; Litvinova; Morozova; Yatsechko, 2015; Silva, et al., 2014; \nUgura; Nnachi; Nkwagu, 2015).\nRegarding to consumer behaviour study, researchers such as Bevilacqua \n(2013); Sata (2013); Moreira, Chauvel and silva (2013); Silva, Pine and De Muylder \n(2014); Lima Filho et al.

Finding and discussion\nConsumer buying behaviour mention to the selection, purchase and consumption \nof goods or service for their satisfaction. There is different process connected to consumer \nbehaviour. Some factors, have specific characters influencing in their decision-making\nprocess, shopping habits, brands and so forth. Therefore, it can be separated with socio-\npsychogical factor as the following:\nRegarding to socio-psychogical factor within activities had impact significantly with \npurchasing decision. Due to the consumers eating habits, the most important factors \naffecting the consumption of bakery products. The survey found that the most important \nfactor concern with activities was marketing mix and purchasing decision of bakery \nproducts. They can be attached of rawness and smell of bakery products, perception of the \nreasonable price, sensory such as taste which it also be due to the fact that bakery \nproducts that consumer is used to consume every day.  Moreover, the product lover can \nbe change by reason of social factors. The most important personal factors, influencing the \nbuyer behaviour such as age, occupation income and lifestyle pattern. (Lubica, Kristina, \nZdenka, and Ingrida, 2020; Ching, Chin, Ming and Wan, 2019; Kavitha, Souji, Prabhu, \n2011). According to the study, they were consisted of activities that consumers receive and \nare offered, products and services (Blackwell, Miniard, and Engal, 2013). Similarly, the \nstudy with Hes (2009) was noticed that the factors to purchasing bakery products is ", "doc_id": "ee9af993-7727-4b07-9ca0-542bd7bb5869", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "de64c3a16be190ba1d3f2c3360be0bd634c5d40bf006acb3c008b6a93922f8ea", "extra_info": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "Marketing_and_Socio-Psychological_Factors_Influenc.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2627, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4c06f633-3be8-4086-ae86-b1089a7250e6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "594f0a1d-06ab-4ca5-a588-bc5df267bb71": {"__data__": {"text": "        \nStudies in Business and Economics no. 17(1)/2022\n- 268 -   products quality and perception which including sensory, health and food safety (St\u00e1vkov\u00e1, \nconsumers are attracted to higher nutritiona of bakery products like whole grain bread. \n(Golian et al., 2018; Adam, Hiamey, and Afenyo, 2014). In addition, consumers are also \nattracted to higher nutritional bakery products. Furthermore, the research of Nagyov\u00e1 et al. \n(2012) said that consumers can perceive quality on the basis of other factors such as \nappearance, color and flavor of bakery products. The Most consumers, influence factor is \nprice (Kubicov\u00e1 and K\u00e1dekov\u00e1, 2011), especially the luxury pastries.\nMoreover, socio-psychogical factor within Interest had impact significantly with \npurchasing decision. According to the characteristic of consumers based on their lifestyle, \nwhich can be used to differentiable bakery product form competitors offering, infrastructure \nor market segment. Consumers are influenced by people around, looking for the \ninformation from people or social media factor influencing consumer such as family, \nreference group, roles and status., developing technology and changing living conditions, \nchanging in consumer behaviour. Therefore, manufacturing always show varieties of \nproducts, offering specific products to their consumers (Gustavo, Viviane, Luiz, and \nRecebido, 2016; Kristen, 2011; Ramya & S.A. Mohamed, 2016; Hulya, Fidan, Mevlut, \nMetin, 2017). Similarly, the study of Horsk\u00e1 et al. (2009) said consumer behaviour, \nsatisfaction or efficiency. Consumer behaviour are characterized by carefully, awareness, \nexperience, and evaluation of alternatives (Rovn\u00fd et al., 2010). Also, the model developed \nby Blackwell, Miniard and Engel (2013) illustrate the purchase decision processes as the \nfollowing stages: 1) recognition of need, 2) information search process, 3) evaluation of \npurchase; 4) purchase; 5) consumption, 6) evaluation of post-consumer and disposal \nstages. In addition, there is a relatively high impulse and emotional state when purchasing\nbakery products are influenced by a number of factors such as cultural, social, and \npsychological factors. (G\u00e9ci, Nagyov\u00e1, and Rybansk\u00e1, 2017)\nFurthermore, socio-psychogical factor within Opinion had impact significantly with \npurchasing decision. Marketing segmentation were classified consumers through a \nmerchandise mix that meets their lover for products which is understanding of consumer \nbehaviour.  In addition, it related with social and condition of bakery products which is \nassist grocers, food retailer and service operation to meeting consumer for specific \nproduct. Moreover, price is the most important factor influencing because some consumers \ndo not have stable income. The place in marketing mix is also convincing them to buy \nbakery product which are available in supermarkets, bakery shop and so forth. \nAdditionally, the bakery products it has alternative forms for sale, such as in fast food.\nTherefore, the bakery store needs to improve their marketing mix, and also have to \nfocus on the lacking areas which they need to apply the marketing mix on their bakery \nstore in order to get more attraction and recognition by the consumers. Feedback from \nconsumers is also important in order to enhance their performance and product quality \n(Ching, Chin, Ming and Wan, 2019; Kavitha, Souji, Prabhu, 2011; Abdullah, Ahmad, Nural, \nAhmad, Nur, & Mohd, 2019).

There are many factors \nthat people use for selecting bakery shop such \nas review form the internet or the taste of the \nfood.    \nMeans End Chain theory (MEC) was applied \nby using the laddering technique of interview \nthat rarely used in Thailand. Because Means \nEnd Chain must take long time to collect data \nin one consumer. To ensure that the answer \nfrom the consumer was exactly what they want \nto answer and also to know the real feeling \nwhen they answer the questions.  \nThe aims of this research were to apply Means \nEnd Chain technique to the food service study \nin a case study of bakery restaurant service and \nto find the most famous attributes that \ninfluencing bakery shop selection of people in \nBangkok. \nMeans End Chain Theory  \nMeans \nend chain theory is a marketing \nresearch technique used when the researcher \ngenerally tries to probe the mind of the \ncustomer to bring out the distinctions of \nconsumer behavior.

It can be feeling, taste, emotional or \nanything that consumer can imagine. Means \nEnd Chain gave the freedom for consumer to \nthink by their own and the information that \ncame out will be the original consumer insight. \nMeans End Chain technique in Foodservice \nIn 2013, Tengpongsathon and others found that \nthe application of Means -End Chain theory for \nstudying consumer  attitude  on green tea \nbeverages was conducted.  The 60 consumers  \nwere interviewed by laddering interview \ntechnique to generate green tea beverage \nqualities.

Germination is a process to \nincrease the nutritive value, especially \ngamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA ) . \nTherefore, this study aimed to develop sn ack \nbars from the germinated sweet corn . The \nexperimental design by Mixture Design was \nused, and seven snack bars formulas \ncontaining 50 -70% germinated sweet corn, \n20-40% black sesame, 10 -30% pumpkin\nseed, 25 % oat, and 20 % honey were\ninvestigated for physi cal (hardness and\ncolor ), chemical (proximate analysis, GABA\nand antioxidant activity (DPPH assay ),\nmicrobiological properties (total plate count\nand yeast and mold ) and sensory evaluation\nusing 9 point hedonic scale . The results\nindicated that the hardnes s of snack bar\nincreased when an addition of germinated\nsweet corn, black sesame and pumpkin seed\nincreased (P<0.05) .  Lightness (L* )\nsignificantly decreased when black sesame\nincreased (P<0.05), whereas redness (a* )\nsignificantly decreased when pumpkin see d\nincreased (P<0.05) . In addition, yellowness\n(b*) significantly increased when germinated\nsweet corn increased (P<0.05) .  The\nproximate composition in term of \ncarbohydrate and moisture content \nsignificantly increased when germinated sweet corn increased (P<0.05), while fat \nsignificantly increased with the addition of \nblack sesame and protein content \nsignificantly increased with the addition of \npumpkin seed (P<0.05). However, there were \nno significant difference in sugar and crude \nfiber in all samples (P>0.05) .  In addition, \nGABA content considerably increased when \na proportion of germinated sweet corn \nincreased in the formula (P<0.05) .  The \nresults also exhibited that total plate count \nand yeast and mold of all samples was less \nthan 25 and 10 CFU /g, respective ly. \nFurthermore, sensory evaluation by 30 \nuntrained panelists showed no significant \ndifference in overall attribute in formula 2, 7, \n3 and 6 (P>0.05). In conclusion, the formula \n6 which consisted of 33 % germinated sweet \ncorn, 11 % black sesame 11 % pumpkin s eed, \n25% oat and 20 % honey contained 2 .53\u00b10 .00 \nmg/g d.b.

GABA is \nproduced by the decarboxylation of L -\nglutamic acid that contains a four carbon \namino acid . GABA is provided many \nbeneficial effects for human health such as an \ninhibitory neurotransmitter in the \nsympathetic nervous system, controlling \nstress and decreasing blood pressure  [4]. \nGerminated cereal grains , such as barley, rice \nand soybean,  have been widely studied for \nGABA production [5]. Thao and Niwat [6] \nshowed that the germination of colored rice \nat pH 6 significantly increased GABA, total \nphenolic contents and antioxidants activities \nof germinated rice compared to non-\ngerminated rice .   \nSesame (Sesamum indicum  L.) has high \nnutritional value due to the significant \namounts of dietary fiber, protein, natural \nantioxidants, unsaturated fatty acids, \nvitamins, and mineral constituents present in \nits composition . The chemical composition of \nsesame seed shows 58 % oil, 2 5% protein, \n13.5% carbohydrate and 5 % ash [7]. The \nlipid fraction of sesame seeds shows good \noxidative stability, which is contributed from  \nthe essential fatty acids (e.g. oleic, linoleic, \nand arachidonic  acid) present in its \ncomposition, as well as antiox idant \ncompounds (e.g., sesamin, sesamolin, and \nsesamol ) [8].  \nThe main component in pumpkin seed is a \nlipid, approximately 51 %. Pumpkin seed oil \nis rich in unsaturated fatty acids including \nlinoleic acid (55.6% of total lipid ) and oleic \nacid (20.4% of total lipid ). Pumpkin seed oil \nhas been produced worldwide due to h igh \nnutritional effects for human health [9]. \nWhole grain oats are a rich source of dietary \nfiber, micronutrients, and macronutrients . \nThe health -promoting effects have been related to fiber and potentially to the abilities \nof other oat -derived components or factors in \nmodulating oxidative stress, inflammator y \nstress, and glycemic response [10]. Dietary \nfiber in whole grain oat foods, especially \u03b2 -\nglucans, is a key component i n mitigating \nglycemic response . In addition to, oats are \nalso rich sources of phen olics including \nflavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, and \navenanthramides (A VEs ) [11]. \nHoney is a rich source of carbohydrates, and \nused as a natural sweetener . In addition, \nhoney is i mportant sour ce of other minor \nconstituents  such as polyphenols, \ncarotenoids, minerals, proteins, free amino \nacid, enzymes and vitamins [12].

Next, corn was soaked by \ndistilled water with the corn -water ratio = 1:5 \n(w/v) at 35\uf0b0C for 18 hours at pH 6 using \ncitric acid . Soaked sweet corn was  rinsed \nwith water  and placed in a plastic box \ncovered with a lid and germinated at 37\u02daC for \n48 hours . Afterward, germinated sweet corn \nwas heated by a tray dryer at 50\u02daC for 2 \nhours to stop germination  and final moisture \ncontent below 15% was received .  \nExperimental design  \nMixture design was used w ith different ratio \nof 50-70% germinated sweet corn, 20-40% \nblack sesame, and 10-30% pumpkin seed . \nHoney and oat were fixed at 20 and 25 %, \nrespectively . Then, 7 formulations of snack \nbar were shown in Table 1 .  \nSnack bars processing  \nSnack bars processing was modified from the \nmethod described by LaRue et al . [14] and \nBuakum and Lopphu, [15]. Firstly, \ngerminated sweet corn was mixed with other \ningredients  in a mixing bowl . After that, the \nmixture was transferred to a baking  pan that \nplaced the parchment paper on the bottom . \nAn extra sheet of parchment paper was used  \nto press on top of the mixture to form  the bar \nshape with approximate 0.5 cm thickness . Then,  the mixture was  baked at 150\u02daC for 15 \nminutes and cooled down on a rack . The \nsnack was cut into 1 .5x3.0 cm2 piece  using a \nserrated knife . The snack bar was w rapped \nindividually with plastic wrap and stored at 4 \n\u02daC for further analysis .  \nTable 1 The ratio of germinated corn, black \nsesame, pumpkin seed, oat, and honey for \nmaking snack bars  \nFormula  Germinated \nsweet corn \n(%) Black \nsesame \n(%) Pumpkin \nseed \n(%) Honey \n(%) Oat \n(%) \n1 38.5 11 5.5 20 25 \n2 27.5 11 16.5 20 25 \n3 27.5 22 5.5 20 25 \n4 33 14 8 20 25 \n5 33 16.5 5.5 20 25 \n6 33 11 11 20 25 \n7 27.5 16.5 11 20 25 \nExtraction \nAll of the samples were carried out by the \nmethod described by Thao and Niwat [6]. \nGround samples (1 g) were extracted with 15 \nml of 70 % methanol and covered with the \naluminum foil at room temperature (28\u02daC ) \nfor 12 hours, and then filtrated by filter \npapers (Whatman no .4).

The tubes \nwere shaken again for 1 min and cooled in \nice bath for 5 min, then incubated in boiling \nwater bath for 10 min . After cooling the \nsample  to room temperature , the absorbance \nof each sample was evaluated against a blank \nat 630 nm . The GABA co ntent was expressed \nas mg GABA /100 g db samples .  \nDetermination of DPPH radical \nscavenging activity (DPPH assay ) \nThe DPPH assay was determined according \nto the method of Molyneux [17] using Trolox \n(0-1000 \u00b5g /ml) as standard . Each extract \nsample (50 \u00b5l ) was mixed with 1 .95 ml 60 \n\u00b5M DPPH solution and left in the dark place for 30 min at room temperature . The \nabsorbance of the samples was measured at \n517 nm using methanol as blank . The \ncalibration curve was plotted between Trolox \nconcentration (\u00b5M) and % inhibition . The \nDPPH radical scavenging activity of the \nsample  was expressed as \u00b5mole TE / g db \nsample . \nMicrobiological analysis  \nTotal plate count and  yeast and  mold of snack \nbar from germinated sweet corn were \ndetermined according to the procedures \naccording to  AOAC  [16]. \nSensory evaluation  \nTaste, color, texture, appearance and overall \nacceptability of germinated sweet corn bar \nwere assessed by 30 untrained panelists using \na 9-point hedonic scale , which 1= extremely \ndislike, 5 = moderate ly liked and 9 = like \nextremely . \nStatistical analysis  \nData were expressed as means \u00b1 standard \ndeviation . All experiments conducted in this \nstudy were performed in triplicate . The \ngeneral linear model procedure of the \nStatistical Analysis System (SPSS, version \n16)was used for data analysis . Ducan \u2019s test\nwas conducted to compare mean at 5 %\nsignificance (P<0.05).\nRESULT S AND DISCUSSION  \nTexture profile analysis (TPA ) \nThe hardness  of germinated sweet corn bar  \nwas found in the range of 5 .11-9.21 N (Table \n2). The hardness increased when an addition \nof germinated sweet corn, black sesame, and  \n306\nView publication stats", "doc_id": "336f37cb-1648-4500-a49a-def2c6bcec03", "embedding": null, "doc_hash":
